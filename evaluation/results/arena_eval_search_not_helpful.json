The numbers show the total number of air passengers for each month in those years. \\n\\n\n\nText 2: SUMMARY:\\nThe paper proposes a method to automatically compute hypergradients or gradients of hyperparameters during backpropagation, enabling hyperparameter optimization for gradient descent optimizers like SGD and NAME_1. The authors achieve this by making a simple modification to standard backpropagation. This allows hyperparameters beyond just learning rates, like momentum coefficients, to be optimized. The technique can be recursively applied to optimize hyper-hyperparameters and beyond, creating \"hyperoptimizers\". The authors find that as the number of nested hyperoptimizer layers increases, the algorithm becomes less sensitive to the initial choice of hyperparameters. They implement their approach in PyTorch and evaluate it on various neural networks for image classification, language modeling and other tasks, demonstrating the benefits of hyperoptimizers.\\n\\n\n\nText 3: SUMMARY: The paper proposes a sequence-to-sequence model named Neural Corpus Indexer (NCI) which generates relevant document identifiers directly from a query. NCI can be trained end-to-end using queries and corresponding document identifiers. To optimize NCI's performance, the paper proposes a prefix-aware weight-adaptive decoder architecture, query generation technique, semantic document identifiers, and consistency-based regularization. Experiments on NQ320K and TriviaQA datasets show that NCI achieves significant gains over baselines, with up to 21.4% and 16.8% relative improvement in Recall@1 and R-Precision respectively. NCI's enhanced MRR score demonstrates its potential as an end-to-end retrieval solution. However, NCI still suffers from scaling and efficiency issues that need to be addressed for real-world deployment.\\n\n\nList all possible text numbers related to the question.

        "gpt_4o_answer": "Desde un enfoque ecl\u00e9ctico, que integra diversas teor\u00edas y perspectivas psicol\u00f3gicas, el origen de una adicci\u00f3n puede entenderse como un fen\u00f3meno multifac\u00e9tico que involucra interacciones complejas entre factores biol\u00f3gicos, psicol\u00f3gicos y sociales.\n\n1. **Biol\u00f3gico**: Desde el punto de vista biol\u00f3gico, las adicciones pueden originarse en el cerebro debido a la liberaci\u00f3n de neurotransmisores como la dopamina, que est\u00e1n asociados con el placer y la recompensa. Cuando una persona consume una sustancia o realiza una actividad adictiva, se produce una sobrecarga de dopamina, que crea una sensaci\u00f3n de euforia y bienestar. Con el tiempo, el cerebro se adapta a estos niveles elevados de dopamina, y la persona necesita consumir m\u00e1s de la sustancia o realizar m\u00e1s la actividad para alcanzar el mismo nivel de satisfacci\u00f3n, lo que puede llevar a la dependencia.\n\n2. **Psicol\u00f3gico**: Desde una perspectiva psicol\u00f3gica, las adicciones pueden surgir como mecanismos de afrontamiento para manejar el estr\u00e9s, el trauma, la ansiedad o la depresi\u00f3n. Las personas pueden recurrir a sustancias o comportamientos adictivos como una forma de escapar temporalmente de sus problemas emocionales o psicol\u00f3gicos. La teor\u00eda del aprendizaje, por ejemplo, sugiere que las conductas adictivas se refuerzan a trav\u00e9s del condicionamiento operante, donde el refuerzo positivo y negativo juega un papel crucial en el mantenimiento de estas conductas.\n\n3. **Social**: En t\u00e9rminos sociales, las adicciones pueden originarse a partir de la influencia del entorno y la cultura. La presi\u00f3n de grupo, la disponibilidad de sustancias, y las normas culturales que rodean el uso de ciertas sustancias o la participaci\u00f3n en ciertas actividades pueden contribuir significativamente al desarrollo de una adicci\u00f3n. Adem\u00e1s, el modelado social, donde las personas aprenden comportamientos observando a otros, tambi\u00e9n puede desempe\u00f1ar un papel importante.\n\nDesde un enfoque ecl\u00e9ctico, es fundamental reconocer que estos factores no operan de forma aislada, sino que interact\u00faan entre s\u00ed. La predisposici\u00f3n gen\u00e9tica puede influir en c\u00f3mo una persona responde a las sustancias, pero las experiencias individuales y el contexto social tambi\u00e9n son cruciales. Comprender el origen de una adicci\u00f3n requiere una visi\u00f3n integradora que considere todas estas dimensiones para abordar eficazmente la prevenci\u00f3n y el tratamiento.",
        "gpt_4o_agent_answer": "Desde una perspectiva ecl\u00e9ctica en psicolog\u00eda, el origen de una adicci\u00f3n puede ser entendido como un proceso complejo que involucra m\u00faltiples factores interrelacionados. No se trata simplemente de un factor singular, sino de una convergencia de elementos biol\u00f3gicos, psicol\u00f3gicos y sociales.\n\n1. **Biol\u00f3gicos:** Las adicciones pueden originarse por cambios neuroqu\u00edmicos en el cerebro. Las sustancias adictivas o comportamientos adictivos pueden estimular el sistema de recompensa del cerebro, liberando neurotransmisores como la dopamina, que generan sensaciones de placer y refuerzo. Esto puede llevar a un ciclo de b\u00fasqueda compulsiva de la sustancia o comportamiento para replicar esas sensaciones placenteras.\n\n2. **Psicol\u00f3gicos:** Desde un enfoque psicol\u00f3gico, la adicci\u00f3n puede surgir como una forma de gestionar el estr\u00e9s, la ansiedad, la depresi\u00f3n u otras emociones dif\u00edciles. Las personas pueden recurrir a sustancias o comportamientos adictivos como mecanismos de afrontamiento para escapar de sus problemas o emociones dolorosas. Adem\u00e1s, ciertas personalidades pueden tener una mayor predisposici\u00f3n a la b\u00fasqueda de sensaciones o a comportamientos impulsivos, lo que tambi\u00e9n puede contribuir al desarrollo de una adicci\u00f3n.\n\n3. **Sociales:** El entorno social y cultural tambi\u00e9n juega un papel crucial en el origen de las adicciones. La presi\u00f3n de grupo, la disponibilidad de sustancias, las normas culturales y los modelos de comportamiento observados en el entorno pueden influir significativamente en el desarrollo de una adicci\u00f3n. Adem\u00e1s, la falta de apoyo social o la exposici\u00f3n a ambientes disfuncionales pueden aumentar la vulnerabilidad a las adicciones.\n\n4. **Interacci\u00f3n de Factores:** Es importante destacar que estos factores no act\u00faan de manera aislada. A menudo, es la interacci\u00f3n de m\u00faltiples factores lo que contribuye al desarrollo de una adicci\u00f3n. Por ejemplo, una persona con una predisposici\u00f3n biol\u00f3gica a la adicci\u00f3n puede ser m\u00e1s susceptible si tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 expuesta a un entorno social que normaliza el uso de sustancias.\n\nEn resumen, el origen de una adicci\u00f3n es multifac\u00e9tico y debe ser abordado desde un enfoque integral que considere todos estos aspectos para una comprensi\u00f3n completa y eficaz del fen\u00f3meno.\n"
