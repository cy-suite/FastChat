{"question_id": "arena_hard_2", "response": "Here are a few different approaches to generate random permutations for long sequences:\n\n1. Using numpy (most efficient for very long sequences):\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef generate_permutation_numpy(n):\n    # Creates array [0, 1, ..., n-1] and shuffles it in-place\n    perm = np.random.permutation(n)\n    return perm\n```\n\n2. Using random.shuffle (Python's built-in method):\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef generate_permutation_shuffle(n):\n    # Create list of numbers from 0 to n-1\n    numbers = list(range(n))\n    # Shuffle the list in-place\n    random.shuffle(numbers)\n    return numbers\n```\n\n3. Fisher-Yates (Knuth) Shuffle Algorithm (implemented manually):\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef generate_permutation_fisher_yates(n):\n    # Create list of numbers from 0 to n-1\n    arr = list(range(n))\n    \n    # Start from the last element and swap one by one\n    for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        # Pick a random index from 0 to i\n        j = random.randint(0, i)\n        # Swap arr[i] with the element at random index\n        arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n    \n    return arr\n```\n\n4. Using itertools and random (memory efficient for very large sequences):\n```python\nimport random\nfrom itertools import islice\n\ndef generate_permutation_iterator(n):\n    # Create list of numbers from 0 to n-1\n    pool = list(range(n))\n    n = len(pool)\n    \n    for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        j = random.randint(0, i)\n        pool[i], pool[j] = pool[j], pool[i]\n        yield pool[i]\n    if pool:\n        yield pool[0]\n```\n\nExample usage:\n```python\n# For a sequence of length 1 million\nn = 1_000_000\n\n# Using numpy (fastest)\nperm1 = generate_permutation_numpy(n)\n\n# Using random.shuffle\nperm2 = generate_permutation_shuffle(n)\n\n# Using Fisher-Yates\nperm3 = generate_permutation_fisher_yates(n)\n\n# Using iterator (memory efficient)\nperm4 = list(generate_permutation_iterator(n))\n\n# For very large sequences, you might want to process the iterator without converting to list\nfor value in generate_permutation_iterator(n):\n    # Process each value one at a time\n    pass\n```\n\nPerformance comparison:\n```python\nimport time\n\nn = 1_000_000\n\n# Test numpy version\nstart = time.time()\nperm1 = generate_permutation_numpy(n)\nprint(f\"Numpy time: {time.time() - start:.2f} seconds\")\n\n# Test random.shuffle version\nstart = time.time()\nperm2 = generate_permutation_shuffle(n)\nprint(f\"Random.shuffle time: {time.time() - start:.2f} seconds\")\n\n# Test Fisher-Yates version\nstart = time.time()\nperm3 = generate_permutation_fisher_yates(n)\nprint(f\"Fisher-Yates time: {time.time() - start:.2f} seconds\")\n```\n\nSome notes:\n1. The numpy version is typically the fastest for large sequences.\n2. The iterator version is memory efficient as it generates values one at a time.\n3. All methods generate uniformly random permutations.\n4. For very large sequences (billions of numbers), you might need to consider using specialized libraries or disk-based solutions.\n5. If you need cryptographically secure random permutations, you should use `random.SystemRandom()` instead of the standard `random` module.\n\nChoose the method that best fits your specific needs regarding:\n- Speed requirements\n- Memory constraints\n- Whether you need the entire permutation at once or can process it sequentially\n- Security requirements", "search_done": false}

Creates a class with a random 32-bit value\n2. Adds a constraint that counts transitions between adjacent bits using XOR\n3. Forces the sum of transitions to be exactly 5\n\nA transition occurs when adjacent bits are different (0\u21921 or 1\u21920). The XOR operation between adjacent bits will give 1 when there's a transition and 0 when there isn't.\n\nExample outputs might look like:\n```\nGenerated number: 00000000000000011111100000000000 (transitions = 5)\nGenerated number: 11111111000000000000000000000000 (transitions = 5)\nGenerated number: 00000111110000000000000000000000 (transitions = 5)\n```\n\nEach of these numbers will have exactly 5 points where the bit value changes from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0.\n\nYou can verify this by counting the transitions in any generated number - there will always be exactly 5 places where adjacent bits are different.", "search_done": false}

{"question_id": "arena_hard_17", "response": "This error occurs when the NDK build system cannot find the Android.mk file in the specified location. Here's how to fix it:\n\n1. First, verify that the Android.mk file exists in the correct location:\n```\napp/src/main/jni/Android.mk\n```\n\n2. If the file doesn't exist, create it with basic content:\n```makefile\nLOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)\n\ninclude $(CLEAR_VARS)\n\nLOCAL_MODULE := your-module-name\nLOCAL_SRC_FILES := your-source-files.cpp\n\ninclude $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY)\n```\n\n3. Also ensure you have Application.mk in the same directory:\n```makefile\nAPP_ABI := arm64-v8a\nAPP_PLATFORM := android-26\n```\n\n4. Check your build.gradle (app level) configuration:\n```gradle\nandroid {\n    ...\n    defaultConfig {\n        ...\n        externalNativeBuild {\n            ndkBuild {\n                abiFilters 'arm64-v8a'\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    externalNativeBuild {\n        ndkBuild {\n            path \"src/main/jni/Android.mk\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n5. Common issues to check:\n- Ensure there are no spaces in the file path\n- Verify file permissions\n- Make sure the path is correct in build.gradle\n- Check if the NDK is properly installed and configured\n\n6. If using Android Studio:\n- File \u2192 Invalidate Caches / Restart\n- Clean Project and Rebuild\n\n7. Alternative solution using CMake:\nIf ndkBuild isn't working, consider switching to CMake:\n```gradle\nandroid {\n    ...\n    externalNativeBuild {\n        cmake {\n            path \"src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n8. Check NDK path in local.properties:\n```properties\nndk.dir=C\\:\\\\Users\\\\YourUsername\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Android\\\\Sdk\\\\ndk\\\\25.1.8937393\n```\n\n9. If the path contains spaces, try:\n- Moving the project to a path without spaces\n- Using the short path notation (8.3 format) in Windows\n\n10. Verify NDK version compatibility:\n```gradle\nandroid {\n    ndkVersion \"25.1.8937393\"\n}\n```\n\nIf the issue persists:\n1. Create a new project and copy your files gradually\n2. Try using a different NDK version\n3. Use CMake instead of ndkBuild\n4.

Using BoxWithConstraints:\n```kotlin\n@Composable\nfun ResponsiveContainer() {\n    BoxWithConstraints {\n        when {\n            maxWidth < 400.dp -> {\n                // Layout for small width\n                Column {\n                    Item1()\n                    Item2()\n                }\n            }\n            maxWidth < 800.dp -> {\n                // Layout for medium width\n                Row {\n                    Item1()\n                    Item2()\n                }\n            }\n            else -> {\n                // Layout for large width\n                Row(horizontalArrangement = Arrangement.SpaceEvenly) {\n                    Item1()\n                    Item2()\n                    Item3()\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2. More complex example with different layouts based on both width and height:\n```kotlin\n@Composable\nfun AdaptiveContainer() {\n    BoxWithConstraints {\n        val isCompact = maxWidth < 400.dp\n        val isMedium = maxWidth in 400.dp..800.dp\n        val isExpanded = maxWidth > 800.dp\n        val isPortrait = maxHeight > maxWidth\n\n        when {\n            isCompact && isPortrait -> {\n                CompactPortraitLayout()\n            }\n            isCompact && !isPortrait -> {\n                CompactLandscapeLayout()\n            }\n            isMedium -> {\n                MediumLayout()\n            }\n            isExpanded -> {\n                ExpandedLayout()\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n3.

Using Monte Carlo method (probabilistic approach):\n```javascript\nfunction calculatePiMonteCarlo(points) {\n    let insideCircle = 0;\n    \n    for (let i = 0; i < points; i++) {\n        const x = Math.random();\n        const y = Math.random();\n        \n        // Check if point is inside quarter circle\n        if (Math.sqrt(x * x + y * y) <= 1) {\n            insideCircle++;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return 4 * (insideCircle / points);\n}\n\nconsole.log(calculatePiMonteCarlo(1000000));\n```\n\n4. Using Ramanujan's formula (fast convergence):\n```javascript\nfunction calculatePiRamanujan(iterations) {\n    let sum = 0;\n    const factor = 2 * Math.sqrt(2) / 9801;\n    \n    for (let k = 0; k < iterations; k++) {\n        let numerator = factorial(4 * k) * (1103 + 26390 * k);\n        let denominator = Math.pow(factorial(k), 4) * Math.pow(396, 4 * k);\n        sum += numerator / denominator;\n    }\n    \n    return 1 / (factor * sum);\n}\n\nfunction factorial(n) {\n    if (n === 0) return 1;\n    let result = 1;\n    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        result *= i;\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\nconsole.log(calculatePiRamanujan(2)); // Just a few iterations needed\n```\n\n5. Using Math.PI (built-in constant):\n```javascript\nconsole.log(Math.PI); // Most accurate and efficient way\n```\n\nNotes:\n1. The built-in `Math.PI` is the most accurate and efficient way to get \u03c0 in JavaScript.\n2. The iterative methods above are mainly for educational purposes.\n3. Different methods have different convergence rates:\n   - Leibniz formula converges slowly\n   - Nilakantha series converges faster than Leibniz\n   - Monte Carlo method is probabilistic and requires many points for accuracy\n   - Ramanujan's formula converges very quickly but requires factorial calculations\n\nExample usage:\n```javascript\nconsole.log(\"Leibniz:\", calculatePi(1000000));\nconsole.log(\"Nilakantha:\", calculatePiNilakantha(100000));\nconsole.log(\"Monte Carlo:\", calculatePiMonteCarlo(1000000));\nconsole.log(\"Ramanujan:\", calculatePiRamanujan(2));\nconsole.log(\"Math.PI:\", Math.PI);\n```\n\nEach method has its own trade-offs between accuracy, speed, and complexity. For practical applications, always use `Math.PI`. These implementations are more useful for learning about different mathematical approaches to calculating \u03c0.", "search_done": false}

{"question_id": "arena_hard_41", "response": "Here's a draft research introduction for your topic:\n\nIntroduction:\n\nDurian (Durio zibethinus), often referred to as the \"King of Fruits\" in Southeast Asia, represents a significant agricultural commodity with growing global market demand. The successful cultivation of durian largely depends on the precise timing and conditions for floral induction, which ultimately determines fruit yield and quality. Understanding the complex interplay between environmental factors, particularly climate and soil conditions, and their influence on durian flowering has become increasingly crucial for optimizing production systems.\n\nRecent advances in data analytics and environmental monitoring technologies have opened new avenues for investigating the intricate relationships between environmental parameters and plant physiological responses. While traditional agricultural practices rely heavily on empirical knowledge, a data-driven approach offers the potential for more precise and scientifically-grounded decision-making in durian cultivation.\n\nClimate factors, including temperature fluctuations, rainfall patterns, and relative humidity, have been recognized as key drivers of floral induction in tropical fruit trees. Similarly, soil conditions, such as moisture content, nutrient availability, and pH levels, play vital roles in determining flowering success. However, the quantitative relationships between these variables and their combined effects on durian flowering remain inadequately understood.\n\nThis research aims to leverage comprehensive environmental data sets and advanced analytical techniques to elucidate the specific impacts of climate and soil parameters on durian floral induction. By identifying critical thresholds and optimal conditions through statistical analysis and machine learning approaches, this study seeks to develop predictive models that can guide agricultural practices and improve flowering management strategies.\n\nUnderstanding these relationships is particularly relevant in the context of climate change, as shifting weather patterns and increasing environmental variability pose new challenges for durian cultivation. The insights gained from this data-driven investigation will not only contribute to the scientific understanding of tropical fruit tree physiology but also provide practical applications for farmers and agricultural stakeholders in optimizing durian production systems.\n\n[Note: You may want to customize this introduction further based on your specific research focus, methodology, and regional context.]", "search_done": false}

{"question_id": "arena_hard_47", "response": "Yes, you're correct. The issue is that the Python code needs to authenticate with Power BI before it can download the PDF. When you access the URL in your browser, you're already logged in, but the Python requests need to include authentication credentials. Here's a modified version of your code that should work:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport msal\nimport os\n\n# Azure AD app registration details\nclient_id = \"YOUR_CLIENT_ID\"\nclient_secret = \"YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET\"\ntenant_id = \"YOUR_TENANT_ID\"\n\n# Power BI API endpoint\nauthority = f\"https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant_id}\"\nscope = [\"https://analysis.windows.net/powerbi/api/.default\"]\n\n# Create MSAL app instance\napp = msal.ConfidentialClientApplication(\n    client_id,\n    authority=authority,\n    client_credential=client_secret\n)\n\n# Get access token\nresult = app.acquire_token_silent(scope, account=None)\nif not result:\n    result = app.acquire_token_for_client(scopes=scope)\n\nif \"access_token\" in result:\n    # Use the access token to make the request\n    headers = {\n        \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {result['access_token']}\"\n    }\n    \n    full_url = \"https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/rdlreports/1bdef01c-30a3-4150-aff2-b3ec4c9edf86?rp:AdviceDeathScriptMERGEDMonthStartDate=6/1/2023&rp:AdviceDeathScriptMERGEDIncomingcall=Aria%20Park&rdl:format=PDF\"\n    \n    response = requests.get(full_url, headers=headers)\n    \n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        filename = \"AriaPark.pdf\"\n        with open(filename, 'wb') as file:\n            file.write(response.content)\n        print(\"Report has been successfully downloaded.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Failed to download report.

Install required packages:\n```bash\npip install msal requests\n```\n\n2. Register an application in Azure AD:\n   - Go to Azure Portal > Azure Active Directory > App registrations\n   - Create a new registration\n   - Get the Client ID and Tenant ID\n   - Create a client secret\n\n3. Replace the placeholder values in the code:\n   - YOUR_CLIENT_ID\n   - YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET\n   - YOUR_TENANT_ID\n\n4. Make sure the registered application has the necessary permissions to access Power BI:\n   - In Azure Portal, go to your app registration\n   - Click on API permissions\n   - Add permission for Power BI Service\n   - Grant admin consent\n\nThis code uses the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to handle the authentication process with Azure AD and obtain an access token, which is then used to authenticate the request to Power BI.\n\nAlso, make sure that the service account associated with these credentials has the necessary permissions in Power BI to access the report you're trying to download.\n\nIf you're still having issues, you might want to check:\n1. The response status code\n2. The response content\n3. The permissions of your application\n4. The Power BI workspace and report permissions\n\nYou can add more error handling and debugging information like this:\n\n```python\nresponse = requests.get(full_url, headers=headers)\nprint(f\"Status Code: {response.status_code}\")\nprint(f\"Response Headers: {response.headers}\")\nif response.status_code != 200:\n    print(f\"Error Content: {response.content}\")\n```", "search_done": false}
