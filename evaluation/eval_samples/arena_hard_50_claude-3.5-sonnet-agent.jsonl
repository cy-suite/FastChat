Using itertools.permutations (Simplest Method):\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Generate all permutations of numbers 1 to n\nn = 3\nperms = list(permutations(range(1, n+1)))\nprint(perms)\n```\n\n2. Using Recursive Backtracking:\n```python\ndef permutation(lst):\n    # Base cases\n    if len(lst) == 0:\n        return []\n    if len(lst) == 1:\n        return [lst]\n    \n    l = [] # List to store permutations\n    \n    # Recursive case: Try each element as first element\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        m = lst[i]\n        # Get remaining list excluding current element\n        remLst = lst[:i] + lst[i+1:]\n        # Generate permutations of remaining list\n        for p in permutation(remLst):\n            l.append([m] + p)\n    return l\n\n# Example usage\ndata = list('123')\nfor p in permutation(data):\n    print(p)\n```\n\n3. Using Fisher-Yates Shuffle Algorithm (For Random Single Permutation):\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef shuffle(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    # Start from last element and swap with random earlier position\n    for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        j = random.randint(0, i)\n        arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n    return arr\n\n# Example usage\narr = list(range(1, 6))  # [1,2,3,4,5]\nshuffled = shuffle(arr.copy())\nprint(shuffled)\n```\n\nKey points:\n- itertools.permutations is best for generating all possible permutations\n- Recursive backtracking works well for small inputs but can be slow for large n\n- Fisher-Yates shuffle is most efficient for generating a single random permutation\n- Time complexity: O(n!) for generating all permutations, O(n) for single random permutation\n- Space complexity: O(n!) for storing all permutations, O(n) for single permutation\n\nChoose the appropriate method based on whether you need:\n1.

{"question_id": "arena_hard_3", "response": "Based on the sentence \"The design of capsule networks appears to be most well-suited for classification problems which have clearly defined entities and might be less well-suited to problems where entities are more difficult to define, such as weather patterns\", I agree with this assessment for the following reasons:\n\n1. Capsule networks are specifically designed to model hierarchical relationships between parts and wholes, and to encode spatial relationships between features. This works well for objects with clear component parts and spatial structure (like faces, digits, etc.).\n\n2. The key innovation of capsule networks is their ability to preserve and encode pose information and spatial relationships between features using vectors rather than scalar values. This is most beneficial when dealing with structured objects where spatial relationships matter.\n\n3. Weather patterns tend to be more amorphous, continuous phenomena without clearly defined component parts or rigid spatial relationships. The features that define weather patterns (temperature gradients, pressure systems, etc.) don't have the same kind of clear hierarchical structure that capsule networks excel at modeling.\n\n4. The routing-by-agreement mechanism in capsule networks works by finding agreement between lower and higher level feature detectors. This is most effective when there are clear, consistent relationships between parts and wholes, which may not be the case for weather patterns.\n\n5. The literature shows capsule networks have been most successful on tasks involving structured objects like digit recognition, face detection, and object classification - domains with well-defined entities and clear part-whole relationships.\n\nSo while capsule networks are a powerful architecture, their core design principles make them better suited for problems involving discrete, structured entities rather than continuous, amorphous phenomena like weather patterns. The sentence accurately captures this key characteristic of capsule networks.\nReference Website: \n\n- [Capsule Network with Its Limitation, Modification, and Applications\u2014A Survey](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-4990/5/3/47)\n- [Capsule networks for image classification: A review - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925231222010657)\n- [Capsule neural network - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_neural_network)", "search_done": true}

{"question_id": "arena_hard_6", "response": "Based on the provided sources, here are the most common optimizations for BVHs in ray tracing:\n\n1. Traversal Order Optimization:\n- Choose traversal order (left vs right child) based on ray direction to check the closer node first\n- Store a split axis in each node and use ray direction to determine optimal traversal order\n- This provides better early termination when boxes don't overlap\n\n2. Memory Layout Optimizations:\n- Use compact node representations to improve cache coherence \n- Reorder nodes in depth-first search order for better memory access patterns\n- Avoid pointer fragmentation by allocating nodes contiguously\n- Use indices instead of pointers to reduce memory usage, especially for large scenes\n\n3. Construction Optimizations:\n- Choose effective splitting strategies (e.g. surface area heuristic)\n- Build quality BVHs that minimize node overlap\n- Use techniques like approximate agglomerative clustering for faster construction\n- Consider spatial splits to handle dense geometry better\n\n4. Early Exit Optimizations:\n- Take advantage of non-overlapping bounding boxes to terminate traversal early\n- Clip ray length when intersection is found to avoid unnecessary traversal\n- Skip subtrees that can't contain closer intersections\n\n5. Hardware Acceleration:\n- Use dedicated ray tracing cores (like NVIDIA RT Cores) to accelerate BVH traversal\n- Optimize BVH structure for hardware traversal units\n- Take advantage of SIMD/vector instructions for intersection tests\n\n6. Quality Improvements:\n- Minimize volume of bounding boxes\n- Reduce overlap between sibling nodes\n- Balance the tree structure while maintaining good spatial subdivision\n- Pay special attention to nodes near the root since they affect all traversals\n\nThe key is balancing construction time, memory usage, and traversal performance while considering the specific requirements of the application (real-time vs offline rendering, static vs dynamic scenes, etc.).\nReference Website: \n\n- [Bounding volume hierarchy - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounding_volume_hierarchy)\n- [Notes on efficient ray tracing](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~boulos/papers/efficient_notes.pdf)\n- [Ray Tracing | NVIDIA Developer](https://developer.nvidia.com/discover/ray-tracing)", "search_done": true}

Create multiple network interfaces with different private IPs:\n\n```hcl\nresource \"aws_network_interface\" \"scraper_eni\" {\n  count = 10 # Create 10 network interfaces\n\n  subnet_id       = aws_subnet.main.id\n  private_ips     = [\"10.0.1.${count.index + 10}\"] # Assign sequential IPs\n  security_groups = [aws_security_group.allow_web.id]\n\n  attachment {\n    instance     = aws_instance.scraper.id\n    device_index = count.index + 1 # Start from 1 since primary interface is 0\n  }\n\n  tags = {\n    Name = \"scraper-eni-${count.index}\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3. Associate Elastic IPs with each network interface:\n\n```hcl\nresource \"aws_eip\" \"scraper_eip\" {\n  count = 10\n\n  vpc               = true\n  network_interface = aws_network_interface.scraper_eni[count.index].id\n  \n  # Associate with the specific private IP\n  private_ip = aws_network_interface.scraper_eni[count.index].private_ips[0]\n\n  tags = {\n    Name = \"scraper-eip-${count.index}\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n4.

{"question_id": "arena_hard_11", "response": "Based on the reference material, I'll help you create SystemVerilog constraints to ensure exactly 5 transitions in a 32-bit number. A transition occurs when adjacent bits change from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0.\n\nHere's the solution:\n\n```systemverilog\nclass MyClass;\n  rand bit [31:0] num;\n  \n  // Constraint to ensure exactly 5 transitions\n  constraint num_transitions {\n    // Count transitions by XORing num with right-shifted version\n    // and counting the 1's in the result\n    ($countones(num ^ (num >> 1))) == 5;\n  }\nendclass\n```\n\nHow this works:\n\n1. The expression `num ^ (num >> 1)` performs an XOR between the number and itself shifted right by 1 bit\n   - This creates a 1 wherever adjacent bits are different (i.e., where there's a transition)\n\n2. `$countones()` counts the number of 1's in the XOR result, which equals the number of transitions\n\n3. Setting this equal to 5 ensures exactly 5 transitions\n\nExample usage:\n```systemverilog\nmodule tb;\n  initial begin\n    MyClass c = new();\n    repeat(5) begin\n      void'(c.randomize());\n      $display(\"num = %b, transitions = %0d\", \n               c.num, $countones(c.num ^ (c.num >> 1)));\n    end\n  end\nendmodule\n```\n\nThis will generate 32-bit numbers with exactly 5 transitions between adjacent bits. For example:\n- 00000111110000000000000000000000 (5 transitions)\n- 11111000000000000000000000000000 (5 transitions)\n\nThe constraint ensures that any randomized value will have exactly 5 bit changes when scanning from LSB to MSB or vice versa.\nReference Website: \n\n- [Constraint - SystemVerilog - Verification Academy](https://verificationacademy.com/forums/t/constraint/32214)\n- [SystemVerilog Constraint Examples](https://www.chipverify.com/systemverilog/systemverilog-constraint-examples)", "search_done": true}

{"question_id": "arena_hard_18", "response": "Based on the provided references, I can demonstrate how user \"eve\" could potentially steal a password from user \"bob\" when he executes a command with a password as a command line argument:\n\n```bash\n# As user eve, repeatedly run ps to see command line arguments of other users' processes\nwhile true; do\n  ps aux | grep bob\n  sleep 0.1\ndone\n```\n\nThis works because:\n\n1. Command line arguments are visible to all users through the ps command and /proc filesystem by default\n\n2. When a password is passed as a command line argument, it appears in clear text in ps output for a brief period before the program can overwrite it\n\n3. Even if the program overwrites the argument quickly, there's a small time window where the password is exposed\n\n4. By repeatedly running ps in a loop, eve can catch the password during this window of vulnerability\n\nThis is why passing sensitive information like passwords via command line arguments is considered unsafe. Better alternatives include:\n\n1. Using environment variables \n2. Reading passwords from protected files\n3. Using interactive password prompts\n4. Using password managers or key stores\n5. Using APIs that properly handle secrets\n\nThe fundamental issue is that command line arguments are designed to be visible system-wide for debugging and monitoring purposes, making them inappropriate for sensitive data.\n\nThe best solution is to modify applications to avoid passing secrets via command line arguments entirely. If that's not possible, techniques like the ones shown in the references (overwriting argv[], using LD_PRELOAD tricks etc) can help reduce but not eliminate the risk.\nReference Website: \n\n- [security - How does ps know to hide passwords? - Unix & Linux Stack Exchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/88665/how-does-ps-know-to-hide-passwords)\n- [linux - How to hide a password passed as command line argument? - Server Fault](https://serverfault.com/questions/592744/how-to-hide-a-password-passed-as-command-line-argument)", "search_done": true}

Sets up an OpenAI-compatible client pointing to your local FastChat server\n2. Maintains conversation context for follow-up questions\n3. Provides a simple command-line interface for interaction\n4. Handles errors gracefully\n5. Allows you to exit the conversation using 'quit', 'exit', or 'bye'\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nYou: Hello! What is your name?\nAssistant: I am an AI assistant based on the Vicuna model. How can I help you today?\nYou: What can you help me with?\nAssistant: [Model provides response with context from previous interaction]\n```\n\nThe script maintains the conversation history, so the model can reference previous exchanges when responding to follow-up questions. You can modify parameters like temperature and max_tokens to adjust the model's responses.\n\nRemember to install the required packages:\n```bash\npip install openai fastchat\n```\n\nThis implementation provides a basic but functional chat interface with conversation memory. You can extend it further by adding features like:\n- Saving conversations to files\n- Multiple model support\n- Custom temperature and token settings\n- Web interface integration\n- Response streaming\nReference Website: \n\n- [Deploying LLM with FastChat.

Using dict.fromkeys() (Preserves order in Python 3.7+):\n```python\nmy_list = list(dict.fromkeys(my_list))\n```\n\n3. Using OrderedDict (Preserves order in all Python versions):\n```python\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\nmy_list = list(OrderedDict.fromkeys(my_list))\n```\n\n4. Using a loop (Preserves order but slower):\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(lst):\n    result = []\n    for item in lst:\n        if item not in result:\n            result.append(item)\n    return result\n```\n\n5.

{"question_id": "arena_hard_29", "response": "Based on the provided materials, I'll summarize the key points about the acceptance-rejection method:\n\nKey Concepts:\n\n1. Purpose:\n- Used when direct sampling or inverse transform method is difficult/inefficient\n- Generates samples from a target distribution with density f(x) using a proposal distribution with density g(x)\n\n2. Requirements:\n- Need a proposal distribution g(x) that is easy to sample from\n- Must find a constant c > 0 such that f(x) \u2264 cg(x) for all x\n- Support of target f must be subset of support of proposal g\n\n3. Algorithm Steps:\n```\n1. Generate y from proposal distribution g(x)\n2. Generate u from Uniform(0,1) \n3. If u \u2264 f(y)/(cg(y)), accept y as sample\n   Otherwise, reject and return to step 1\n```\n\n4. Key Properties:\n- Number of iterations follows geometric distribution with p = 1/c\n- Expected number of iterations = c\n- Smaller c means more efficient algorithm\n- Accepted samples follow target distribution f(x)\n\n5. Important Considerations:\n- Choice of proposal g(x) should:\n  - Be easy to sample from\n  - Resemble shape of target f(x)\n  - Minimize constant c\n- Method becomes less efficient in higher dimensions\n- Only need to know f(x) and g(x) up to proportionality constants\n\n6. Advantages:\n- Can sample from complex distributions\n- Exact sampling (not approximate)\n- Simple to implement\n\n7. Disadvantages:\n- Rejection rate can be high if c is large\n- Inefficient in high dimensions\n- Requires knowing target density up to proportionality\n\nThe key to efficient implementation is choosing a good proposal distribution g(x) that closely matches f(x) while still being easy to sample from.\nReference Website: \n\n- [6.3 Rejection Sampling | Advanced Statistical Computing](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/advstatcomp/rejection-sampling.html)\n- [Rejection sampling - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejection_sampling)\n- [1 Acceptance-Rejection Method](http://www.columbia.edu/~ks20/4703-Sigman/4703-07-Notes-ARM.pdf)", "search_done": true}

{"question_id": "arena_hard_28", "response": "Here's a summary of the key points about reading from TCP sockets in C/C++ based on the sources:\n\n1. Basic Socket Reading:\n```cpp\n// Read with error handling\nint readResult = read(socketFileDescriptor, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE);\nif (readResult < 0) {\n    // Handle error\n}\n```\n\n2. Proper Way to Read Fixed Length:\n```cpp\nvoid ReadXBytes(int socket, unsigned int x, void* buffer) {\n    int bytesRead = 0;\n    while (bytesRead < x) {\n        int result = read(socket, buffer + bytesRead, x - bytesRead);\n        if (result < 1) {\n            // Handle error\n        }\n        bytesRead += result;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n3. Key Considerations:\n\n- Always check return values from read()\n- Handle partial reads by keeping track of bytes read\n- Consider using select() for non-blocking I/O\n- Buffer size should be appropriate for your use case\n- Handle connection closure (read returns 0)\n- Consider byte ordering (network vs host)\n\n4. Using select() for Non-blocking:\n```cpp\nfd_set read_set;\nstruct timeval timeout;\nFD_ZERO(&read_set);\nFD_SET(socketFileDescriptor, &read_set);\ntimeout.tv_sec = 60;\ntimeout.tv_usec = 0;\n\nint ready = select(socketFileDescriptor+1, &read_set, NULL, NULL, &timeout);\nif (ready > 0) {\n    // Socket ready for reading\n    read(socketFileDescriptor, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE);\n}\n```\n\n5. Error Handling:\n```cpp\nif (readResult == 0) {\n    // Connection closed by peer\n} \nelse if (readResult < 0) {\n    if (errno == EAGAIN || errno == EWOULDBLOCK) {\n        // Non-blocking socket has no data\n    } else {\n        // Handle other errors\n    }\n}\n```\n\n6. Best Practices:\n\n- Use a protocol/header to know message lengths\n- Consider using non-blocking I/O with select()\n- Handle partial reads properly\n- Clean up resources properly\n- Use appropriate buffer sizes\n- Consider using higher level libraries like libpcap for complex cases\n\nThe most robust approach depends on your specific needs, but generally involves:\n\n1. Using a proper protocol to frame messages\n2. Handling partial reads correctly\n3. Using select() for non-blocking I/O\n4. Proper error handling\n5.

{"question_id": "arena_hard_32", "response": "Based on the reference, here's how to solve the symfony/security upgrade issue from Symfony 4 to 5:\n\n1. The main issue is that `symfony/security` package no longer exists in Symfony 5. It has been split into multiple packages.\n\n2. You need to replace `symfony/security` in your composer.json with these separate packages:\n\n```json\n\"symfony/security-core\": \"^5.0\",\n\"symfony/security-http\": \"^5.0\", \n\"symfony/security-csrf\": \"^5.0\",\n\"symfony/security-guard\": \"^5.0\"\n```\n\n3. Additional steps that may be needed:\n\n- Remove the old `\"symfony/security\": \"5.0.*\"` line from composer.json\n- Run `composer update`\n- You may need to install `symfony/error-handler` separately with:\n  ```\n  composer require symfony/error-handler\n  ```\n- Update namespace references to Debug class in your public/index.php file\n\n4. If you encounter many compatibility issues, consider:\n- Creating a new Symfony 5 project\n- Migrating your /src and /assets folders\n- Updating configurations as needed\n\nThe key point is that the security component was refactored into separate packages in Symfony 5, so you need to use the new split packages instead of the single symfony/security package.\n\nFor a complete upgrade guide, you can refer to the blog post mentioned in the answer: \"How we Upgraded Pehapkari.cz from Symfony 4 to 5 in 25 days\".\nReference Website: \n\n- [composer php - Cannot update symfony/security from 4.4.1 to 5.0.1 - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59338850/cannot-update-symfony-security-from-4-4-1-to-5-0-1)", "search_done": true}

First, we create a CTE (Common Table Expression) called `previous_purchases` that:\n   - Takes each customer-product-week combination\n   - Uses a CASE statement with EXISTS to check if the same customer bought the same product (basket_key) in the previous 6 weeks\n   - Labels the customer as 'existing' if they had a purchase in the previous 6 weeks, or 'new' if they didn't\n\n2. The main query then:\n   - Joins this classification back to the original sales table\n   - Returns all original columns plus the new customer_type classification\n   - Orders the results by week, product, and customer for easy reading\n\nSome important notes:\n- This assumes the 'week' column is a numeric representation of the week (like week number of the year)\n- The solution handles multiple purchases by the same customer in the same week\n- The classification is specific to each product (basket_key), so a customer could be \"new\" for one product but \"existing\" for another in the same week\n- If a customer hasn't purchased in the last 6 weeks, they will be classified as \"new\" again, even if they purchased the product before that period\n\nAlternative approaches could include using LAG or window functions, but the EXISTS approach is generally more efficient for this type of lookback analysis.\n\nIf you need to modify the lookback period, you can simply change the number 6 in the `BETWEEN a.week - 6 AND a.week - 1` clause to your desired number of weeks.\n", "search_done": false}
{"question_id": "arena_hard_37", "response": "Based on the references, here are the key ways to put an image on the same line as text and have the text wrap around it:\n\n1.

{"question_id": "arena_hard_41", "response": "Based on the provided references, I'll help draft a research introduction on \"Data-Driven Insights into the Impact of Climate and Soil Conditions on Durian Floral Induction\":\n\nDurian (Durio zibethinus Murr.), known as the \"King of Fruits\" in Southeast Asia, is a commercially significant tropical fruit crop whose production is heavily influenced by environmental conditions, particularly climate and soil factors. The timing and success of floral induction in durian trees are critical determinants of fruit production and harvest scheduling, making it an important area of scientific investigation for optimizing cultivation practices.\n\nResearch has established that water stress plays a fundamental role in triggering durian flowering, with studies indicating that a minimum drought period of 18-21 days with rainfall less than 1 mm/day is typically required for floral initiation. This relationship between dry weather stress and flowering has been documented across major durian-producing regions, where distinct dry spells correlate with predictable flowering and subsequent harvesting seasons.\n\nHowever, the complex interactions between environmental factors and flowering response present ongoing challenges for producers. While moderate water stress promotes flowering, excessive drought can inhibit flower development, and wet humid conditions typically reduce flower numbers. Additionally, variations in soil conditions, temperature regimes, and other environmental parameters can significantly impact the effectiveness of natural and artificial flower induction methods.\n\nModern agricultural management techniques, including the application of plant growth regulators like paclobutrazol and various soil management practices, have emerged as potential tools for manipulating flowering patterns. However, their effectiveness appears to be highly dependent on precise environmental conditions and timing of application.\n\nThis research aims to analyze comprehensive data on climate patterns, soil conditions, and their combined effects on durian floral induction, with the goal of developing more precise and reliable flowering management strategies. By examining these relationships through a data-driven approach, we seek to enhance our understanding of the environmental factors controlling durian flowering and improve the predictability and consistency of fruit production.\n\n[Note: This introduction synthesizes key points from the provided references while setting up a research framework focused on data-driven analysis of environmental factors affecting durian flowering.]\nReference Website: \n\n- [The effect of dry weather stresses on flower induction of durian and on... | Download Scientific Diagram](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-effect-of-dry-weather-stresses-on-flower-induction-of-durian-and-on-the-fruit_fig1_282132631)\n- [Development of technologies to extend the durian production period | International Society for Horticultural Science](https://www.ishs.org/ishs-article/1186_17)\n- [Effects of Paclobutrazol Application and Soil Mulching on Flower Induction and Physiological Conditions in Durian Trees (Durio zibethinus Murr.) | Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences | JIRCAS](https://www.jircas.go.jp/en/publication/jarq/2023j06)", "search_done": true}
