This led to legal battles between the companies, which Western Union ultimately won.\n\nSo in 1874, Edison began developing the multiplex/quadruplex telegraph system, which allowed for multiple messages to be transmitted simultaneously over telegraph lines.

Why \u03b4(X) = adX:\n- This comes from using the adjoint representation of the Lie algebra\n- The adjoint representation ad maps elements X of the Lie algebra to derivations adX where adX(Y) = [X,Y]\n- In this case, they are using the adjoint representation as the coefficient module, so \u03b4 maps to adX\n\n2. The notation u(u1,u2,u3,u4):\n- As noted in the comments, this appears to be a typo\n- It should be written as u = (u1,u2,u3,u4) \u2208 g\n- This is just specifying a vector u in the Lie algebra g with components ui\n\n3. Why C1(g,ad) = gl(R,4):\n- C1(g,ad) consists of linear maps from g to g using the adjoint representation\n- Since g is 4-dimensional over R, these are just 4x4 matrices\n- Therefore C1(g,ad) is isomorphic to gl(R,4), the space of 4x4 real matrices\n\nThe Chevalley-Eilenberg complex in general:\n- It provides a way to compute Lie algebra cohomology\n- The complex is built from exterior powers of the dual of the Lie algebra\n- The differential \u03b4 is defined using the Lie bracket and representation\n- The cohomology measures properties of the Lie algebra and its representations\n\nThe key is that this complex allows us to systematically compute cohomology groups that give important invariants of the Lie algebra structure.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to expand on any of these points further.\nReference Website: \n\n- [Lie algebra cohomology - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebra_cohomology)\n- [Lie Algebra Homology and Cohomology](https://math.mit.edu/~hrm/palestine/weibel/07-lie_algebra_homology_and_cohomology.pdf)\n- [homology cohomology - Chevalley\u2013Eilenberg Complex of Lie algebra - Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4994068/chevalley-eilenberg-complex-of-lie-algebra)", "search_done": true}
