The vote resulted in 441 members voting in favor, 94 against, and 4 abstentions, with several members of the Communist Party and some Social Democrats being absent or already in detention[1][2][3].

{"question_id": "simple_qa_45", "response": "The Pakistan People's Party (PPP) has had several instances where it has been the leading opposition party in Pakistan on a national level, but specific counts can be complex due to the dynamic nature of Pakistani politics. Here are some key points:\n\n- After the 2008 general elections, the PPP formed the government, and the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) (PML-N) became the main opposition party. However, in previous periods, the PPP has been in opposition several times[5].\n\n- Before 2008, the PPP was in opposition during the PML-N's rule under Nawaz Sharif in the 1990s and early 2000s. For example, after the 1993 parliamentary elections, the PML-N was in power, and the PPP was the main opposition party[5].\n\n- After the 2013 general elections, the PML-N formed the government again, and the PPP was the second-largest party but not necessarily the main opposition, as that role was often contested with other parties like the PTI[3].\n\nGiven these points, it is challenging to provide an exact number, but the PPP has been a significant opposition force multiple times, particularly during the PML-N's periods in power. However, a precise count of each instance where they were the \"leading\" opposition party is not readily available from the provided sources.\nReference Website: \n\n- https://www.business-standard.com/external-affairs-defence-security/news/pak-govt-registers-cases-against-bushra-bibi-kp-cm-gandapur-over-pti-march-124113000128_1.html\n- https://www.arabnews.com/node/2581178/amp\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Tehreek-e-Insaf\n- https://www.geo.tv/latest/577148-we-have-to-bring-political-stability-either-via-dialogue-or-baton-bilawal-hits-out-at-pti\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Muslim_League_(N)", "search_done": true}

{"question_id": "simple_qa_219", "response": "The Shinto burial process, while not as extensively detailed as some other funeral rituals, involves several key steps and rituals that are integrated into the broader funeral and mourning practices. Here are some of the main elements:\n\n## Preparation and Funeral Rites\n- **Purification**: Before the funeral, participants often purify themselves, for example, by washing their hands and mouth at the *Temizuya* using cups[3].\n\n## Funeral Ceremony\n- **Separation**: The deceased is separated from the living through rituals. This can include the preparation of the body and the removal of items associated with death.\n- **Transition**: The funeral ceremony itself marks a transition phase. This may involve rituals such as the recitation of prayers and the performance of specific rites to guide the spirit of the deceased.\n- **Incorporation**: After the funeral, there are rituals to reincorporate the mourners back into their community. For example, a ceremony of purification might be performed to mark the end of the mourning period[4].\n\n## Specific Shinto Practices\n- **Cremation or Burial**: Shinto funerals often involve cremation, followed by the burial of the ashes. However, the specifics can vary depending on regional and family traditions.\n- **Memorial Services**: After the funeral, memorial services (*Tsuya*) are held to honor the deceased. These services can include the offering of food, incense, and prayers[4].\n\n## Post-Funeral Rituals\n- **Period of Mourning**: There is a period of mourning during which certain restrictions may apply to the family and close relatives.\n- **Purification and Reintegration**: At the end of the mourning period, purification rituals may be performed to symbolize the reintegration of the mourners into normal life. This can include rituals like sprinkling salt and kindling a new fire in the household cooking stove, similar to the purification ceremony described in other contexts[2][3].\n\nWhile these steps are not strictly linear or universally uniform across all Shinto communities, they represent the general framework of the Shinto burial and mourning process.\nReference Website: \n\n- https://voffice.com.sg/understanding-chinese-funeral-traditions-in-singapore/\n- https://www.britannica.com/topic/rite-of-passage/Life-cycle-ceremonies\n- https://aish.com/exploring-the-jewish-roots-of-japan/\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual\n- https://www.britannica.com/topic/rite-of-passage", "search_done": true}
