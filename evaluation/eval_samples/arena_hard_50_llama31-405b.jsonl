This algorithm is both unbiased and efficient, with a time complexity of O(n), making it suitable for very long sequences.\n\nBelow is an example implementation in Python. This code snippet demonstrates how to generate a random permutation of a sequence of numbers from 0 to `sequence_length - 1`. You can adjust the `sequence_length` variable to set the length of your sequence.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef generate_random_permutation(sequence_length):\n    # Generate the initial sequence\n    sequence = list(range(sequence_length))\n    \n    # Apply Fisher-Yates shuffle\n    for i in range(sequence_length - 1, 0, -1):\n        j = random.randint(0, i)\n        # Swap sequence[i] with sequence[j]\n        sequence[i], sequence[j] = sequence[j], sequence[i]\n    \n    return sequence\n\n# Example usage\nsequence_length = 100  # Change this to your desired sequence length\nrandom_permutation = generate_random_permutation(sequence_length)\nprint(random_permutation)\n```\n\nThis code works as follows:\n1. It starts with the original sequence of numbers.\n2. It iterates over the sequence from the last element to the first.\n3. For each element at position `i`, it selects a random position `j` such that `0 <= j <= i`.\n4. It swaps the elements at positions `i` and `j`.\n5.

However, these libraries require a file path or a buffer. To work with a bytestream, you can use the `io` library to create a `BytesIO` object.\n\n2.  **Parse the Bytestream:** You can then use the `pandas.read_csv()` function to read from the `BytesIO` object in chunks.\n\nHere's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to parse a DataFrame from a bytestream without downloading the whole file:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport io\n\ndef parse_bytestream(bytestream, chunksize=10 ** 6):\n    \"\"\"\n    Parse a DataFrame from a bytestream without downloading the whole file.\n\n    Args:\n    - bytestream: A bytestream object containing the data.\n    - chunksize: The number of rows to include in each chunk.\n\n    Yields:\n    - A DataFrame for each chunk of the bytestream.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a BytesIO object from the bytestream\n    bytes_io = io.BytesIO(bytestream)\n\n    # Initialize an empty DataFrame to store the parsed data\n    df = pd.DataFrame()\n\n    # Iterate over the bytestream in chunks\n    while True:\n        # Read a chunk from the bytestream\n        chunk = bytes_io.read(chunksize)\n\n        # If the chunk is empty, break the loop\n        if not chunk:\n            break\n\n        # Create a new BytesIO object for the current chunk\n        chunk_io = io.BytesIO(chunk)\n\n        # Parse the chunk into a DataFrame\n        chunk_df = pd.read_csv(chunk_io)\n\n        # Append the chunk DataFrame to the main DataFrame\n        df = pd.concat([df, chunk_df], ignore_index=True)\n\n        # Yield the current DataFrame\n        yield df\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Create a sample bytestream\n    data = b\"Name,Age\\nJohn,25\\nAlice,30\\nBob,35\"\n    bytestream = io.BytesIO(data)\n\n    # Parse the bytestream in chunks\n    for df in parse_bytestream(bytestream.read()):\n        print(df)\n```\n\n**Note:** This code assumes that the bytestream contains CSV data. If your bytestream contains data in a different format, you may need to adjust the parsing logic accordingly.\n\n**Chunksize:** The `chunksize` parameter controls the number of rows to include in each chunk.

Common techniques include:\n\t* **Top-Down Construction**: Start with the root node and recursively subdivide the space into smaller regions.\n\t* **Bottom-Up Construction**: Start with individual primitives (e.g., triangles) and merge them into larger nodes.\n\t* **Hybrid Construction**: Combine top-down and bottom-up approaches.\n2. **Node Splitting**: When constructing the tree, deciding how to split nodes can significantly impact performance. Common techniques include:\n\t* **Median Split**: Split nodes based on the median of the primitives' centroids.\n\t* **Surface Area Heuristic (SAH)**: Split nodes based on the surface area of the primitives.\n\t* **Midpoint Split**: Split nodes based on the midpoint of the primitives' bounding boxes.\n3. **Tree Balancing**: Balancing the tree ensures that the number of nodes on each branch is roughly equal, reducing traversal time. Techniques include:\n\t* **Tree Rotation**: Rotate nodes to balance the tree.\n\t* **Node Merging**: Merge nodes to reduce tree depth.\n4. **Leaf Node Optimization**: Optimizing leaf nodes, which contain the actual primitives, can improve performance:\n\t* **Primitive Ordering**: Order primitives in leaf nodes to minimize overlap and improve ray-primitive intersection tests.\n\t* **Primitive Batching**: Group multiple primitives together in a single leaf node to reduce memory access.\n5. **Traversal Order**: The order in which nodes are traversed can impact performance:\n\t* **Depth-First Traversal**: Traverse the tree depth-first, exploring each branch before backtracking.\n\t* **Breadth-First Traversal**: Traverse the tree breadth-first, exploring all nodes at a given depth before moving to the next level.\n6. **Ray-Node Intersection**: Optimizing ray-node intersection tests can reduce computation:\n\t* **AABB Intersection**: Use axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) for fast ray-node intersection tests.\n\t* **OBB Intersection**: Use oriented bounding boxes (OBBs) for more accurate ray-node intersection tests.\n7. **Multi-Threading**: BVH traversal can be parallelized using multi-threading, improving performance on multi-core CPUs:\n\t* **Thread-Level Parallelism**: Divide the image into tiles and assign each tile to a separate thread.\n\t* **Data-Level Parallelism**: Divide the BVH tree into smaller chunks and process each chunk in parallel.\n8. **Cache Efficiency**: Optimizing memory access patterns can improve performance:\n\t* **Cache-Friendly Node Layout**: Store nodes in a contiguous block of memory to improve cache locality.\n\t* **Prefetching**: Prefetch nodes and primitives to reduce memory access latency.\n\nThese optimizations can significantly improve the performance of BVH-based ray tracing.

By moving your trading to a company, you aim to have the profits taxed as corporate income, which might be more beneficial. However, be aware that Germany has a complex tax system, and the tax authorities (Finanzamt) may scrutinize your setup to prevent tax evasion.\n\n**Company types and countries:**\nTo achieve your goal, you'll need to create a company that's considered a separate tax entity from yourself. Here are some options:\n\n1. **German GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung)**: A GmbH is a common German company type that can be used for trading. As a GmbH is a separate tax entity, its profits will be subject to corporate tax (K\u00f6rperschaftsteuer). However, be aware that the GmbH's profits will also be subject to a solidarity surcharge (Solidarit\u00e4tszuschlag) and potentially a trade tax (Gewerbesteuer).\n2. **Foreign company with a German branch**: You could establish a company in a foreign country and create a German branch (Zweigniederlassung). This might allow you to take advantage of a more favorable corporate tax rate in the foreign country. However, the German branch would still be subject to German tax laws, and you'd need to comply with German tax regulations.\n3. **Foreign company without a German branch**: If you create a foreign company without a German branch, it might not be subject to German tax laws. However, you'd need to ensure that the company is not considered a German tax resident due to your personal connections to Germany (e.g., management, control, or shareholders).\n\nSome popular countries for incorporating a trading company include:\n\n* **Cyprus**: Known for its favorable corporate tax rate (12.5%) and relatively simple company setup.\n* **Bulgaria**: Offers a low corporate tax rate (10%) and a relatively straightforward incorporation process.\n* **Estonia**: Has a competitive corporate tax rate (20%) and a modern, digital company setup process.\n\n**Important considerations:**\n\n* **Substance requirements**: Ensure that your company has sufficient substance in the country of incorporation, including a physical presence, employees, and decision-making processes.\n* **Transfer pricing**: Be prepared to demonstrate arm's-length transactions between your company and yourself, as well as with other related parties.\n* **Reporting and compliance**: Familiarize yourself with the reporting requirements in both Germany and the country of incorporation.\n* **Tax treaties**: Understand the tax treaty between Germany and the country of incorporation to avoid double taxation.\n\nBefore making a decision, consult with a tax professional or attorney who is familiar with German tax law and international tax planning.

You can also use a process manager like `supervisord` to manage the processes.\n\nIn your Terraform configuration, you can use the `aws_instance` resource's `user_data` attribute to run a script that sets up the parallel execution of your Python script. For example:\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_instance\" \"example\" {\n  # ...

Each instance is bound to a different IP address using the `--bind-ip` argument.\n\nNote that this is just a high-level overview, and you'll need to modify the Terraform configuration to fit your specific use case.

Moreover, the constraint as written doesn't actually ensure that the transitions are from the immediately previous output but rather from the last generated value for `current_value` within the same object instance.\n\nTo accurately implement a constraint that checks transitions from the previous output in a sequence of generated values, you might need to adjust your approach depending on how you're generating and using these values. If you're generating these values in a sequence, you might need to manually track the previous value and adjust your constraint accordingly.\n\nHere's a more sophisticated example that could be used within a sequence or a more complex randomization scheme:\n\n```systemverilog\nclass my_sequence;\n    rand bit [31:0] value;\n    bit [31:0] previous_value;\n\n    constraint transition_count {\n        // For the first value, don't apply the constraint\n        if (previous_value == 0) {\n            1; // Essentially a \"pass\" since it's the first value\n        } else {\n            $countones(value ^ previous_value) == 5;\n        }\n    }\n\n    function void post_randomize();\n        previous_value = value;\n    endfunction\nendclass\n```\n\nHowever, this approach still has limitations, especially if you're dealing with a sequence of values generated across different instances or contexts. For such scenarios, you might need to implement a more manual or procedural approach to track and enforce the constraint.\n\nIn practice, ensuring a specific number of transitions between successive outputs in a sequence of random values can be quite complex, especially when considering the initial conditions and the context of how these values are being generated and used. You might need to adapt the above examples to fit the specifics of your use case, potentially incorporating additional logic or procedural checks outside of the SystemVerilog constraint system.", "search_done": false}

Here's an example of how user \"eve\" could potentially steal the password of user \"bob\" if bob executes a command with a password as a command-line parameter:\n\nLet's assume bob is running a command like this:\n```bash\n$ myprogram --password=mypassword\n```\nTo demonstrate how eve can steal the password, we'll use the `ps` command, which shows information about running processes. Specifically, we'll use the `ps` command with the `-ef` options to display the command-line arguments of all running processes.\n\nAs eve, we can run the following command:\n```bash\n$ ps -ef | grep myprogram\n```\nThis will show us the command-line arguments of the `myprogram` process, including the password:\n```\nbob      1234  0.0  0.0  1234  234  pts/0    S    10:00   0:00 myprogram --password=mypassword\n```\nAs you can see, the password `mypassword` is visible in the output.\n\nAlternatively, eve could use the `ps` command with the `-p` option to specify the PID of the process, like this:\n```bash\n$ ps -p 1234 -o cmd\n```\nThis will display only the command-line arguments of the process with PID 1234, which in this case includes the password:\n```\nmyprogram --password=mypassword\n```\nNote that this is just one example of how an attacker could potentially steal sensitive information passed as command-line arguments. There are other ways to exploit this vulnerability as well.\n\nTo avoid this security risk, it's recommended to use alternative methods for passing sensitive information, such as:\n\n* Using environment variables or configuration files to store sensitive data\n* Using stdin or a secure input method to enter sensitive data\n* Using a secrets management tool or a secure storage solution\n\nIt's also worth noting that some Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, have implemented security features like `hidepid` to restrict access to `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`, which makes it more difficult for attackers to exploit this vulnerability.

This file defines the environment for your project, including the packages you need.\n\n2. **Define LLVM 17 in `shell.nix`**: Add the following content to your `shell.nix` file to include LLVM 17 in your environment:\n\n```nix\n{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:\n\npkgs.mkShell {\n  buildInputs = [\n    pkgs.llvm_17\n  ];\n}\n```\n\n3. **Enter the Nix shell**: Open a terminal, navigate to your project directory where the `shell.nix` file is located, and run:\n\n```bash\nnix-shell\n```\n\nThis command will download and install LLVM 17 (if it's not already installed) and make it available in your current shell session.\n\n### Option 2: Using `nix-env` for a user-level installation\n\nIf you prefer to install LLVM 17 at the user level, outside of a specific project environment, you can use `nix-env`.\n\n1. **Install LLVM 17**: Run the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\nnix-env -iA nixpkgs.llvm_17\n```\n\nThis command installs LLVM 17 and makes it available in your user environment. Note that this method installs the package at the user level, so it will be available outside of any specific project directory.\n\n### Option 3: Using `nix run` for a temporary environment\n\nIf you need LLVM 17 only temporarily and don't want to install it in your environment or project, you can use `nix run`.\n\n1. **Run LLVM 17 temporarily**: Execute the following command:\n\n```bash\nnix run nixpkgs.llvm_17\n```\n\nThis command downloads and runs LLVM 17 without installing it permanently. It's useful for quick tests or when you need a specific version of LLVM for a one-time task.\n\n### Note\n\n- Ensure you have the latest Nixpkgs channel to access the latest packages, including LLVM 17. You can update your channels with `nix-channel --update`.\n- The availability of LLVM 17 might depend on the current state of the Nixpkgs repository. If LLVM 17 is not available, you might need to use an older version or wait until it's packaged.\n\nThese methods provide flexible ways to use LLVM 17 in a Nix shell, catering to different needs and workflows.", "search_done": false}

You can download the installer from the npcap website.\n2. **Choose a programming language**: You can use a programming language like C, C++, or C# to write the Windows service. For this example, I'll use C#.\n3. **Create a new Windows service project**: In Visual Studio, create a new project by selecting \"Windows Service\" under the \"Visual C#\" section.\n4. **Add npcap dependencies**: Add the npcap library to your project by right-clicking on the project in Solution Explorer, selecting \"Manage NuGet Packages,\" and searching for \"npcap\".\n5. **Create a npcap capture instance**: In your Windows service code, create a new instance of the `Pcap` class, which is the main entry point for npcap. You'll need to provide the name of the network interface you want to capture traffic from.\n\nHere's some sample C# code to get you started:\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.ServiceProcess;\nusing Npcap;\n\nnamespace NetworkTrafficDecoder\n{\n    public class NetworkTrafficDecoderService : ServiceBase\n    {\n        private Pcap _pcap;\n\n        public NetworkTrafficDecoderService()\n        {\n            ServiceName = \"NetworkTrafficDecoder\";\n        }\n\n        protected override void OnStart(string[] args)\n        {\n            // Create a new npcap capture instance\n            _pcap = new Pcap(\"Ethernet\", 65535, PcapMode.Promiscuous);\n\n            // Start capturing traffic\n            _pcap.StartCapture();\n        }\n\n        protected override void OnStop()\n        {\n            // Stop capturing traffic\n            _pcap.StopCapture();\n\n            // Dispose of the npcap instance\n            _pcap.Dispose();\n        }\n\n        private void DecodeTraffic(Packet packet)\n        {\n            // TO DO: implement your decoding logic here\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Received packet: {packet.Length} bytes\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n6. **Implement decoding logic**: In the `DecodeTraffic` method, you'll need to implement your logic for decoding the network traffic. This will depend on the specific protocol(s) you're interested in decoding.\n7. **Handle npcap events**: npcap raises events when packets are captured. You'll need to handle these events to receive the captured packets. In the example above, the `DecodeTraffic` method is called for each captured packet.\n8. **Install and start the service**: Once you've built your Windows service, you'll need to install it on your system using the `installutil` command. Then, you can start the service using the Services console or the `net start` command.\n\n**Example use case**:\n\nSuppose you want to decode HTTP traffic on a network interface. You could modify the `DecodeTraffic` method to parse the packet contents and extract the HTTP headers and payload.\n\n```csharp\nprivate void DecodeTraffic(Packet packet)\n{\n    // Check if the packet is an HTTP packet\n    if (packet.Protocol == Protocol.Tcp && packet.DestinationPort == 80)\n    {\n        // Extract the HTTP headers and payload\n        var httpHeaders = packet.Payload.ToString(Encoding.ASCII);\n        var httpPayload = packet.Payload.Skip(httpHeaders.Length).ToArray();\n\n        // Process the HTTP headers and payload\n        Console.WriteLine($\"HTTP Request: {httpHeaders}\");\n        Console.WriteLine($\"HTTP Payload: {httpPayload.Length} bytes\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThis is just a basic example to get you started. You'll need to modify the code to suit your specific requirements and handle any errors that may occur. Additionally, keep in mind that decoding network traffic can be complex and may require a deep understanding of network protocols and packet structures.", "search_done": false}
{"question_id": "arena_hard_22", "response": "The infamous monad! Don't worry, I'll try to explain it in a way that's easy to understand, with relatable examples from real life.\n\n**What is a monad?**\n\nIn Haskell, a monad is a design pattern that helps you work with computations that have effects, such as input/output or exceptions, in a pure functional programming way. Think of it like a container that wraps a value, allowing you to manipulate the value while keeping track of the effects.\n\n**The three monad laws**\n\nTo be a monad, a type must satisfy three laws:\n\n1. **Left identity**: `return a >>= f` equals `f a` (i.e., putting a value in a monad and then applying a function is the same as just applying the function)\n2. **Right identity**: `m >>= return` equals `m` (i.e., applying a function that just returns the value is a no-op)\n3. **Associativity**: `(m >>= f) >>= g` equals `m >>= (\\x -> f x >>= g)` (i.e., applying two functions in a row is the same as applying the first function and then the second)\n\n**Real-life examples**\n\nLet's consider a few examples to illustrate how monads work:\n\n### 1. Maybe monad (Optional values)\n\nImagine you're searching for a book in a library. The book might be on the shelf (represented by `Just book`) or not (represented by `Nothing`).\n\n```haskell\ndata Maybe a = Nothing | Just a\n```\n\nThe `Maybe` monad helps you work with functions that might fail (e.g., `lookupBook :: String -> Maybe Book`). If the book is found, the function returns `Just book`. If not, it returns `Nothing`.\n\n```haskell\nlookupBook :: String -> Maybe Book\nlookupBook title = -- implementation\n\n-- Using the Maybe monad\nexample :: Maybe Book\nexample = lookupBook \"Harry Potter\" >>= \\book -> Just (bookAuthor book)\n```\n\nIn this example, `lookupBook` returns a `Maybe Book`. The `>>=` operator (called \"bind\") applies the function `bookAuthor` to the value inside the `Maybe`, if it exists. If `lookupBook` returns `Nothing`, the entire expression returns `Nothing`.\n\n### 2. IO monad (Input/Output)\n\nThink of a coffee machine that can dispense coffee or tea. The machine's state (e.g., \"coffee\" or \"tea\") is like an `IO` value.\n\n```haskell\ndata IO a = -- implementation\n```\n\nThe `IO` monad helps you work with functions that have side effects, like reading from the console or printing to the screen. For example:\n\n```haskell\ngetDrink :: IO Drink\ngetDrink = do\n  putStrLn \"Choose a drink: coffee or tea?\"\n  drink <- getLine\n  return (if drink == \"coffee\" then Coffee else Tea)\n```\n\nIn this example, `getDrink` returns an `IO Drink`. The `do` notation is syntactic sugar for using the `>>=` operator. The `getLine` function reads from the console, and its result is passed to the `return` function, which wraps it in an `IO` value.\n\n### 3. State monad (Stateful computations)\n\nImagine a simple bank account with a balance. The account's state is like a `State` value.\n\n```haskell\ndata State s a = -- implementation\n```\n\nThe `State` monad helps you work with functions that modify state, like withdrawing money from the account.\n\n```haskell\nwithdraw :: Int -> State Account ()\nwithdraw amount = do\n  balance <- get\n  put (balance - amount)\n```\n\nIn this example, `withdraw` returns a `State Account ()`. The `get` function retrieves the current balance, and `put` updates the balance.\n\nThese examples illustrate how monads help you work with different types of effects in a pure functional programming way. By using monads, you can decouple the effects from the values, making your code more composable and easier to reason about.\n\nI hope this explanation helped you understand monads better!

{"question_id": "arena_hard_23", "response": "Removing Duplicates from a List in Python\n=====================================\n\nThere are several ways to remove duplicates from a list in Python. Here are a few methods:\n\n### Method 1: Using a Set\n\nA set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. We can convert the list to a set and then convert it back to a list to remove duplicates.\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(lst):\n    return list(set(lst))\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6]\nprint(remove_duplicates(my_list))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nNote that this method does not preserve the original order of the list.\n\n### Method 2: Using a List Comprehension\n\nWe can use a list comprehension to create a new list that only includes unique elements.\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(lst):\n    return [x for i, x in enumerate(lst) if x not in lst[:i]]\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6]\nprint(remove_duplicates(my_list))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nThis method preserves the original order of the list.\n\n### Method 3: Using the `dict.fromkeys()` Method (Python 3.7+)\n\nIn Python 3.7 and later, we can use the `dict.fromkeys()` method to remove duplicates while preserving the original order.\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(lst):\n    return list(dict.fromkeys(lst))\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6]\nprint(remove_duplicates(my_list))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nThis method is more efficient than the list comprehension method for large lists.\n\n### Method 4: Using a For Loop\n\nWe can use a for loop to iterate over the list and add unique elements to a new list.\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(lst):\n    unique_lst = []\n    for x in lst:\n        if x not in unique_lst:\n            unique_lst.append(x)\n    return unique_lst\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6]\nprint(remove_duplicates(my_list))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nThis method preserves the original order of the list.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nThere are several ways to remove duplicates from a list in Python. The best method depends on the size of the list and whether you need to preserve the original order. The `dict.fromkeys()` method is the most efficient method for large lists, while the list comprehension method is a good choice for smaller lists.", "search_done": false}

Here's a breakdown of the steps and considerations:\n\n**Key Components:**\n\n1. **Target Distribution (X)**: The distribution from which we want to sample, with probability density function (pdf) `fX(x)`.\n2. **Proposal Distribution (Y)**: A simpler distribution with pdf `fY(y)`, which is easy to sample from.\n3. **Constant (c)**: A positive constant that ensures `fX(x)/fY(x) \u2264 c` for all `x` where `fX(x) > 0`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1. **Generate y from Y**: Sample a value `y` from the proposal distribution `Y` with pdf `fY(y)`.\n2. **Generate u from U(0, 1)**: Sample a value `u` from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1.\n3. **Acceptance Check**: If `u \u2264 fX(y)/(cfY(y))`, then accept `y` as a sample from the target distribution `X`. Otherwise, reject `y` and return to step 1.\n\n**Considerations:**\n\n* **Choose a good proposal distribution**: The proposal distribution `Y` should be easy to sample from and have a similar shape to the target distribution `X`. This will increase the acceptance rate and reduce the number of iterations required.\n* **Minimize c**: The constant `c` should be as small as possible to increase the acceptance rate. A smaller `c` means that more samples from `Y` will be accepted as samples from `X`.\n* **Monitor acceptance rate**: If the acceptance rate is too low, it may be necessary to adjust the proposal distribution or the constant `c`.\n\n**Example Use Case:**\n\nSuppose we want to sample from a complex distribution `X` with pdf `fX(x) = (1+x^2)^(-1.5)`, but it's difficult to sample from directly. We can use a proposal distribution `Y` with pdf `fY(y) = (1+y^2)^(-1)`, which is easier to sample from. By choosing `c = 2`, we can ensure that `fX(x)/fY(x) \u2264 c` for all `x`.

Otherwise, it returns `#f` (false).\n\nYou can test this function with some examples:\n```scheme\n(odd? 3)  ; returns #t\n(odd? 4)  ; returns #f\n(odd? 11) ; returns #t\n```\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input `n` is an integer. If you want to extend the function to work with other types of numbers, you may need to modify the implementation accordingly.\n\nAlso, as a side note, in Scheme, it's conventional to use the `?` suffix to indicate that a function returns a boolean value.

{"question_id": "arena_hard_37", "response": "To achieve this layout using CSS Flexbox, you can use the `flex-wrap` property and make the paragraph a flex item that can wrap around the image. However, Flexbox itself doesn't directly support text wrapping around images like a float in a straightforward manner. \n\nInstead, you can use the `float` property for the image and Flexbox for the container to achieve a somewhat similar effect. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <img src=\"your-image.jpg\" alt=\"Your Image\" class=\"image\">\n  <p class=\"text\">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer nec odio. Praesent libero. Sed cursus ante dapibus diam. Sed nisi. Nulla quis sem at nibh elementum imperdiet. Duis sagittis ipsum. Praesent mauris. Fusce nec tellus sed augue semper porta. Mauris massa. Vestibulum lacinia arcu eget nulla. Class aptent taciti sociosqu ad litora torquent per conubia nostra, per inceptos himenaeos.</p>\n</div>\n```\n\n```css\n.container {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: row;\n}\n\n.image {\n  float: left;\n  width: 200px; /* Adjust according to your image width */\n  height: auto;\n  margin-right: 20px;\n}\n\n.text {\n  flex: 1;\n}\n```\n\nHowever, the above approach might not work perfectly as expected because Flexbox doesn't directly support text wrapping around images like a float.\n\nA better approach would be to use CSS Grid or the `float` property without Flexbox. Here's an example using `float`:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <img src=\"your-image.jpg\" alt=\"Your Image\" class=\"image\">\n  <p class=\"text\">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

The first Common Table Expression (CTE), `week_dates`, gets the minimum date for each week.\n2. The second CTE, `recent_customers`, gets the customers who purchased each product in the previous 6 weeks by joining the `sales` table with the `week_dates` CTE.\n3.

The `CalculatePi` method uses the Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe formula to calculate Pi up to the specified number of decimal places.\n2. The result is then converted to an integer by multiplying by 100000 (to preserve 5 decimal places) and stored in `piInt`.\n3. The XOR operation is performed on `piInt` twice, which effectively cancels out the operation, resulting in 0.\n4. The calculated Pi and XOR result are printed to the console.\n\n**Note**: The XOR operation on the same value twice will always result in 0, as `a ^ a = 0` for any integer `a`. This is a fundamental property of the XOR operation.", "search_done": false}

The key is C major, and the time signature is 4/4. The melody features a mix of stepwise motion and some larger intervals, with a repetitive structure that is typical of folk tunes.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the notation:\n\n* `X:1` indicates that this is a single-line melody (i.e., not a multi-part piece).\n* `T:Folk Tune` sets the title of the piece.\n* `M:4/4` sets the time signature to 4/4.\n* `L:1/8` sets the default note length to an eighth note.\n* `[C]`, `[G]`, and `[Em]` indicate chord changes (C major, G major, and E minor, respectively). These are not necessarily meant to be played as full chords, but rather as a guide for accompaniment.\n* The melody itself is written using standard ABC notation, with letters representing pitches and numbers representing durations (e.g., `G2` means a G note lasting two eighth notes).\n\nI hope you enjoy this melody!

The `[^>]*` part matches any characters that are not a `>`.\n* `transform\\s*=\\s*` matches the `transform` attribute name, followed by any whitespace characters, followed by an `=` sign, followed by any whitespace characters.\n* `[\"']matrix\\(0\\.998638,0,0,-0\\.998638,0\\.39215,439\\.799858\\)[\"']` matches the value of the `transform` attribute, which is a string containing the specified matrix values. The `[\"']` part matches either a double quote or a single quote, and the `matrix\\(...\\)` part matches the matrix values. The `\\.` matches a literal period character.\n* `[^>]*>` matches any remaining attributes or content inside the `<g>` element, followed by the closing `>` tag.\n\nTo account for line breaks, you can add the `s` flag to the regex pattern, like this:\n```\n<g[^>]*transform\\s*=\\s*[\"']matrix\\(0\\.998638,0,0,-0\\.998638,0\\.39215,439\\.799858\\)[\"'][^>]*>s\n```\nThis flag tells the regex engine to treat the entire string as a single line, so that line breaks are ignored.\n\nNote that this pattern assumes that the `transform` attribute is contained within the `<g>` element, and not within a child element.
