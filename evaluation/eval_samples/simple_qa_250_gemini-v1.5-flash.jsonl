This can last for one or more nights.\n\n* **Funeral Service (S\u014dshiki):** This is the main ceremony, often held at a temple or a funeral hall.  It involves prayers, offerings, and sometimes a eulogy.\n\n* **Procession (Y\u016bso):** The body is then transported to the burial site.\n\n* **Burial (Haikan):** The body is interred, often in a simple wooden coffin, sometimes cremated first.  The specifics of the burial itself vary greatly.\n\n* **Post-Burial Rites:**  These may include further memorial services and visits to the grave.\n\n\nTherefore, while you could potentially break down these phases into dozens of individual steps, it's more helpful to understand the overall flow of the process rather than trying to assign a specific number.
