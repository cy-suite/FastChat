We assume the numbers are drawn uniformly at random without replacement.\n\n**Base Cases:**\n\n* **E(0, M) = 0:** If the player has no numbers (N=0), the game ends immediately.\n* **E(N, N) = N:** If the total number of numbers equals the number of numbers assigned to the player, all the player's numbers will be drawn in exactly N rounds.\n\n**Recursive Step:**\n\nIn the first round, the probability of drawing one of the player's numbers is N/M.  If this happens, we have N-1 numbers left to draw from M-1 remaining numbers.  If we *don't* draw one of the player's numbers, we still have N numbers to draw, but now from M-1 remaining numbers.\n\nTherefore, the recursive formula is:\n\nE(N, M) = (N/M) * [1 + E(N-1, M-1)] + [(M-N)/M] * [1 + E(N, M-1)]\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **(N/M):** Probability of drawing one of the player's numbers in the first round.\n* **[1 + E(N-1, M-1)]:** If we draw one of the player's numbers, we add 1 to the expected number of rounds (for the round we just played) and then recursively calculate the expected number of rounds needed to draw the remaining N-1 numbers from the remaining M-1 numbers.\n* **[(M-N)/M]:** Probability of *not* drawing one of the player's numbers in the first round.\n* **[1 + E(N, M-1)]:** If we don't draw one of the player's numbers, we add 1 to the expected number of rounds and recursively calculate the expected number of rounds needed to draw the N numbers from the remaining M-1 numbers.\n\n\nThis formula accurately captures the expected number of rounds by considering the two possibilities after the first round and weighting them by their probabilities.

{"question_id": "arena_hard_2", "response": "Generating a truly random permutation of a very long sequence in memory can be problematic due to memory constraints.  The most efficient approach depends on whether you need the entire permutation in memory at once or if you can process it sequentially.\n\n**Method 1:  Fisher-Yates Shuffle (In-place, suitable for moderately long sequences)**\n\nThis is the classic algorithm for shuffling an array in place.  It's efficient for sequences that fit comfortably in memory.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef fisher_yates_shuffle(arr):\n  \"\"\"Shuffles an array in-place using the Fisher-Yates algorithm.\"\"\"\n  n = len(arr)\n  for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    j = random.randint(0, i)\n    arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]  # Swap elements\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_list = list(range(1000))  # A moderately long sequence\nfisher_yates_shuffle(my_list)\nprint(my_list) \n```\n\n**Method 2:  Generating Permutations Sequentially (For very long sequences)**\n\nIf your sequence is too large to fit in memory, you can generate the permutation sequentially using a generator. This avoids loading the entire permutation into memory.  This method uses a variation of the Fisher-Yates shuffle.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef sequential_permutation(n):\n  \"\"\"Generates a random permutation of numbers 0 to n-1 sequentially.\"\"\"\n  used = [False] * n\n  for i in range(n):\n    j = random.randrange(n)\n    while used[j]:\n      j = random.randrange(n)\n    used[j] = True\n    yield j\n\n# Example usage (generates a permutation of a sequence of length 1,000,000):\nfor i in sequential_permutation(1000000):\n  # Process each element of the permutation here.  \n  # You don't need to store the entire permutation in memory.\n  print(i) # Example: print each element as it's generated.\n\n```\n\n**Method 3:  Using a library for extremely large sequences (Disk-based)**\n\nFor truly massive sequences that exceed available RAM, you'll need a library that handles external sorting or utilizes disk-based shuffling.  This is significantly more complex to implement.  Libraries like `dask` or specialized database systems might be necessary.\n\n\n**Choosing the right method:**\n\n* **Method 1 (Fisher-Yates):** Best for sequences that fit comfortably in memory.  Simple and efficient.\n* **Method 2 (Sequential):**  Essential for sequences too large for memory.  Requires careful consideration of how you process the generated permutation.\n* **Method 3 (Disk-based):** Necessary for extremely large sequences that exceed available RAM and disk space becomes a limiting factor.  More complex to implement.\n\n\nRemember to choose the method that best suits the size of your sequence and your available resources.

{"question_id": "arena_hard_1", "response": "You can't directly parse a Pandas DataFrame from a byte stream without loading *some* of the data into memory.  Pandas' DataFrame reading functions (like `read_csv`, `read_excel`, etc.) need to at least partially process the data to understand its structure and build the DataFrame.  However, you can minimize memory usage by using techniques that process the data in chunks or iteratively.\n\nHere are a few approaches, depending on the format of your byte stream:\n\n**1. Chunked Reading (for CSV and similar delimited files):**\n\nThis is the most efficient method for large CSV or similar delimited files.  You read the file in smaller chunks, process each chunk, and then discard it.  This prevents loading the entire file into memory at once.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport io\n\ndef parse_csv_bytestream_chunked(byte_stream, chunksize=10000):\n    \"\"\"Parses a CSV byte stream in chunks.\n\n    Args:\n        byte_stream: A byte stream object (e.g., from a network request).\n        chunksize: The number of rows to read in each chunk.\n\n    Returns:\n        A generator that yields Pandas DataFrames, one for each chunk.  \n        To combine into a single DataFrame (use with caution for very large files):\n        `pd.concat(parse_csv_bytestream_chunked(byte_stream))`\n    \"\"\"\n    reader = pd.read_csv(io.BytesIO(byte_stream), chunksize=chunksize)\n    for chunk in reader:\n        yield chunk\n\n\n# Example usage (assuming 'byte_stream' is your byte stream):\nfor chunk_df in parse_csv_bytestream_chunked(byte_stream):\n    # Process each chunk_df individually (e.g., calculate statistics, filter rows)\n    print(f\"Processing chunk with {len(chunk_df)} rows\")\n    # ... your processing logic ...\n\n#To combine chunks (use cautiously for massive files):\n# combined_df = pd.concat(parse_csv_bytestream_chunked(byte_stream)) \n```\n\n**2. Iterative Parsing (for other formats):**\n\nFor formats like JSON or XML where a chunked approach isn't directly supported by Pandas, you might need to use a library that allows iterative parsing.  For JSON, the `json` library's `load` function with a file-like object can be used, but you'll need to handle the structure yourself.  For XML, libraries like `xml.etree.ElementTree` offer iterative parsing.\n\n**3. Dask (for very large datasets):**\n\nFor extremely large datasets that exceed available memory even with chunking, consider using Dask. Dask is a parallel computing library that allows you to work with datasets larger than memory by breaking them into smaller parts and processing them in parallel.  Dask has DataFrame functionality that integrates well with Pandas.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Memory Management:**  Even with chunking, be mindful of memory usage within your processing logic.  Avoid creating large intermediate data structures within the loop.\n* **Error Handling:**  Implement robust error handling (e.g., `try...except` blocks) to gracefully handle potential issues like network errors or malformed data.\n* **Data Type Inference:** Pandas needs to infer data types.  This might require reading a small header portion of the file initially.\n* **File Format:** The optimal approach depends heavily on the file format.  CSV is well-suited for chunked reading; other formats might require different strategies.\n\n\nRemember to replace `byte_stream` with your actual byte stream object (e.g., from `requests.get().content`).  The `io.BytesIO` object creates an in-memory file-like object from your byte stream, allowing Pandas to read it as if it were a regular file.  Choose the method that best suits your data size and format.  For truly massive datasets, Dask is the most scalable solution.", "search_done": false}
{"question_id": "arena_hard_6", "response": "Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) optimizations in ray tracing aim to reduce the number of ray-primitive intersection tests, the dominant cost in many ray tracing applications.  These optimizations can be broadly categorized into:\n\n**1. BVH Construction Optimizations:**  These focus on building a more efficient BVH structure upfront.\n\n* **Surface Area Heuristic (SAH):** This is the most widely used heuristic for BVH construction.  It estimates the cost of traversing a node based on the surface area of its bounding volume and the number of primitives it contains.  The goal is to minimize the expected cost of ray traversal by recursively partitioning the primitives to create balanced and compact nodes.  Variations exist, such as using different cost models or incorporating spatial coherence.\n\n* **Binning:**  Before recursively partitioning, primitives are sorted into bins based on their spatial location. This improves the efficiency of finding good splits by reducing the search space.  Different binning strategies exist, such as uniform or adaptive binning.\n\n* **Spatial Splits:**  How the primitives are split at each node significantly impacts performance.  Common strategies include:\n    * **Median Split:** Splits along the axis with the largest extent, using the median primitive coordinate as the splitting plane.  Simple but can lead to unbalanced trees.\n    * **Surface Area Heuristic (SAH) based splits:**  SAH guides the split selection to minimize the expected cost.\n    * **Spatial Splits based on other heuristics:**  Other heuristics might consider the number of primitives in each child node or the compactness of the bounding volumes.\n\n* **Parallel BVH Construction:**  Building the BVH can be a significant bottleneck.  Parallel algorithms are crucial for leveraging multi-core processors and achieving good performance.  These often involve partitioning the work among threads and employing techniques like work stealing to balance the load.\n\n* **BVH Refinement:**  After initial construction, the BVH can be refined to improve its quality.  This might involve rebuilding parts of the BVH or locally optimizing the structure based on ray tracing patterns.\n\n\n**2. Traversal Optimizations:** These focus on efficiently traversing the already built BVH during ray tracing.\n\n* **Packet Traversal:**  Instead of tracing rays individually, groups of rays (packets) are traversed simultaneously.  This allows for better utilization of SIMD instructions and reduces overhead.\n\n* **Early Ray Termination:**  If a ray intersects a bounding volume, but no primitives inside that volume intersect the ray, the traversal can be terminated early for that ray.\n\n* **Stackless Traversal:**  Traditional BVH traversal uses a stack to keep track of nodes to visit.  Stackless traversal avoids the stack by using iterative methods or specialized hardware instructions, potentially improving performance and reducing memory usage.\n\n* **Spatial Data Structures:**  Combining BVHs with other spatial data structures, such as grids or kd-trees, can improve performance in specific scenarios.  This can be particularly beneficial for handling specific types of scenes or ray distributions.\n\n* **Hardware Acceleration:**  Modern GPUs are highly optimized for ray tracing, and BVH traversal is often accelerated using specialized hardware instructions and memory access patterns.\n\n\n**3. Memory Optimizations:**  These focus on reducing memory usage and improving memory access patterns.\n\n* **Compact BVH Representations:**  Using more compact data structures to represent the BVH can reduce memory footprint and improve cache efficiency.\n\n* **Memory Locality:**  Organizing the BVH data in memory to improve cache coherence can significantly improve performance.\n\n\nThe choice of specific optimizations depends on factors like the scene complexity, the target hardware, and the desired balance between construction time and traversal time.  Often, a combination of these techniques is employed to achieve optimal performance.", "search_done": false}
{"question_id": "arena_hard_9", "response": "Moving your share trading to a company to potentially benefit from different tax rates is a complex decision with significant implications.  There's no single \"best\" answer, as the optimal structure depends heavily on your specific circumstances, trading volume, risk tolerance, and long-term goals.  It's crucial to consult with both a German tax advisor *and* a lawyer specializing in international business law before making any decisions.\n\nThat said, here are some general considerations and potential company types, keeping in mind that **I am not providing financial or legal advice:**\n\n**Company Types and Locations (with significant caveats):**\n\n* **German GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung):** This is a common choice for German entrepreneurs.  While it offers limited liability, the tax implications might not be significantly different from your personal income tax, especially if your trading profits are substantial.  The corporate tax rate in Germany is relatively high.  You'd still be subject to German tax laws.\n\n* **Other EU Countries:**  Setting up a company in another EU country to potentially benefit from lower corporate tax rates is a complex area with significant risks.  The EU is actively working to prevent tax avoidance schemes, and aggressive tax optimization strategies can lead to severe penalties.  You'd still likely need to report your income in Germany under the EU's rules on cross-border taxation.  The administrative burden would be substantial.\n\n* **Countries outside the EU:**  This carries even greater risks and complexities.  You'd need to navigate international tax treaties, comply with reporting requirements in both Germany and the chosen country, and potentially face accusations of tax evasion.  The administrative burden is significantly higher.  Many countries have strict rules about who can own and operate a company within their borders.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Tax Treaties:** Germany has tax treaties with many countries.  These treaties aim to prevent double taxation, but the specifics are complex and depend on the treaty's terms.\n\n* **Substance Requirements:**  Many countries have \"substance requirements\" for companies.  This means the company must have a genuine economic presence in the country (office, employees, etc.) to avoid being considered a shell company.  Simply registering a company in a low-tax jurisdiction without substantial activity there is highly risky.\n\n* **Reputational Risk:**  Aggressive tax planning can damage your reputation and create legal and ethical problems.\n\n* **Administrative Burden:**  Running a company involves significant administrative tasks, including accounting, bookkeeping, and compliance with various regulations.\n\n* **Transaction Costs:**  Setting up and maintaining a company involves legal and administrative fees.\n\n**In short:**  The idea of moving your trading to a company in another country to reduce your tax burden is fraught with legal and financial complexities.  The potential benefits must be carefully weighed against the significant risks and administrative burdens.  **Do not attempt this without professional advice from a German tax advisor and an international business lawyer.**  They can assess your specific situation and advise you on the most appropriate and legal course of action.

This makes it easy to replicate the instance ten times.\n\n```terraform\n# modules/ec2-instance/main.tf\nresource \"aws_instance\" \"ec2\" {\n  ami           = data.aws_ami.amazon_linux.id\n  instance_type = \"t3.micro\" # Choose an appropriate instance type\n\n  # Security Group allowing SSH and potentially your scraping port (e.g., 8080)\n  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.allow_ssh_and_scraping.id]\n\n  # User data to install Playwright and run your script (see below)\n  user_data = data.template_file.user_data.rendered\n}\n\nresource \"aws_security_group\" \"allow_ssh_and_scraping\" {\n  name        = \"allow_ssh_and_scraping\"\n  description = \"Allow SSH and scraping port\"\n\n  ingress {\n    from_port   = 22\n    to_port     = 22\n    protocol    = \"tcp\"\n    cidr_blocks = [\"0.0.0.0/0\"] # Replace with your actual IP or CIDR range for security\n  }\n  ingress {\n    from_port   = 8080 # Replace with your scraping port\n    to_port     = 8080\n    protocol    = \"tcp\"\n    cidr_blocks = [\"0.0.0.0/0\"] # Replace with your actual IP or CIDR range for security\n  }\n\n  egress {\n    from_port   = 0\n    to_port     = 0\n    protocol    = \"-1\"\n    cidr_blocks = [\"0.0.0.0/0\"]\n  }\n}\n\ndata \"aws_ami\" \"amazon_linux\" {\n  most_recent = true\n  owners      = [\"amazon\"]\n  filter {\n    name   = \"name\"\n    values = [\"amzn2-ami-hvm-*\"] # Choose appropriate AMI for your region\n  }\n}\n\ndata \"template_file\" \"user_data\" {\n  template = file(\"user_data.tpl\")\n}\n```\n\n```terraform\n# modules/ec2-instance/user_data.tpl\n#!/bin/bash\nsudo yum update -y\nsudo yum install python3 -y\nsudo yum install python3-pip -y\npip3 install playwright\nplaywright install\npython3 /path/to/your/scraper.py # Replace with the actual path\n```\n\n**2.  Replicate the Module Ten Times:**\n\nIn your main Terraform file:\n\n```terraform\nmodule \"ec2_instance_1\" {\n  source = \"./modules/ec2-instance\"\n}\n\nmodule \"ec2_instance_2\" {\n  source = \"./modules/ec2-instance\"\n}\n# ... repeat for modules 3 through 10\n```\n\n**3.  Important Considerations:**\n\n* **User Data:** The `user_data.tpl` file contains the commands to install Playwright and run your scraper.  **Crucially**, ensure your scraper is designed to handle potential rate limiting and respect the website's robots.txt.  Aggressive scraping can lead to your IPs being blocked.\n* **AMI:** Choose an appropriate Amazon Machine Image (AMI) based on your needs and region.  The example uses Amazon Linux 2.\n* **Instance Type:** Select an instance type that suits your scraping requirements.  `t3.micro` is a small, cost-effective option, but you might need something more powerful depending on your script's resource usage.\n* **Security Groups:**  Restrict the inbound rules in your security group to only allow traffic from trusted sources.  The example uses `0.0.0.0/0` for simplicity, but this is highly insecure for production.\n* **Error Handling:** Add robust error handling to your Python script to gracefully handle network issues and website changes.\n* **Cost:** Running ten EC2 instances concurrently can be expensive. Monitor your costs carefully.\n* **IP", "search_done": false}
{"question_id": "arena_hard_11", "response": "Several approaches exist to constrain the number of transitions in a 32-bit number in SystemVerilog.  The optimal method depends on your specific needs and the context of your design. Here are a few options, with explanations and trade-offs:\n\n**Method 1:  Bit-by-bit comparison (Simple, but less efficient for large bit widths)**\n\nThis method directly compares each bit to its previous value. It's straightforward but becomes less efficient as the bit width increases.\n\n```systemverilog\nclass transaction;\n  rand bit [31:0] output;\n  rand bit [31:0] prev_output;\n\n  constraint transition_count {\n    $countones(output ^ prev_output) == 5;\n  }\nendclass\n\nmodule testbench;\n  transaction trans;\n  initial begin\n    trans = new();\n    repeat (10) begin\n      trans.prev_output = trans.output; //Store previous output\n      trans.randomize() with {trans.transition_count;};\n      $display(\"Output: %b, Transitions: %0d\", trans.output, $countones(trans.output ^ trans.prev_output));\n    end\n  end\nendmodule\n```\n\nThis uses the XOR operator (`^`) to find the bits that changed and `$countones` to count the number of set bits (transitions).  `prev_output` stores the previous value of `output`.\n\n\n**Method 2:  Using a function (More organized, better for larger bit widths)**\n\nThis approach encapsulates the transition counting logic within a function, improving readability and maintainability.\n\n```systemverilog\nfunction automatic int count_transitions(bit [31:0] current, bit [31:0] previous);\n  return $countones(current ^ previous);\nendfunction\n\nclass transaction;\n  rand bit [31:0] output;\n  rand bit [31:0] prev_output;\n\n  constraint transition_count {\n    count_transitions(output, prev_output) == 5;\n  }\nendclass\n\n// testbench remains the same as Method 1\n```\n\n\n**Method 3:  More sophisticated constraint solving (Potentially faster convergence)**\n\nFor very large bit widths or complex scenarios, you might need more advanced constraint solving techniques.  This example uses a loop to iteratively constrain the number of transitions.  It's more complex but can improve randomization efficiency in some cases.  This is generally not necessary for a 32-bit number unless you have extremely tight timing constraints on randomization.\n\n```systemverilog\nclass transaction;\n  rand bit [31:0] output;\n  rand bit [31:0] prev_output;\n\n  constraint transition_count {\n    int trans_count = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) begin\n      if (output[i] !== prev_output[i]) trans_count++;\n    end\n    trans_count == 5;\n  }\nendclass\n\n// testbench remains similar to Method 1\n```\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Initial Value:**  You need to initialize `prev_output` appropriately before the first randomization.  The examples show setting it to the initial value of `output`.\n* **Randomization Efficiency:**  The efficiency of constraint solving can vary depending on the method and the complexity of your constraints.  Method 1 and 2 are generally efficient for 32 bits.\n* **Solver Limitations:**  The SystemVerilog solver might struggle to find a solution if the constraints are too restrictive.  If you consistently encounter issues, you might need to adjust your constraints or use a different randomization technique.\n\n\nRemember to choose the method that best suits your needs and coding style. For a 32-bit number, Method 1 or 2 are likely sufficient and easier to understand.  Method 3 is provided for completeness and situations where more control over the randomization process is needed.  Always test thoroughly to ensure your constraints are working as intended.", "search_done": false}

The `fastchat` documentation provides instructions.\n3. **Adjust the `model_adapter`:**  If you're not using a Vicuna model, you'll need to change `get_model_adapter(model_path, \"vicuna\")` to the appropriate adapter for your chosen model (e.g., `ChatGLMAdapter` for ChatGLM).\n\n**To run:**\n\n1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `fastchat_server.py`).\n2. Run from your terminal: `python fastchat_server.py`\n\nThis will start a server listening on port 8000. You can then connect to it using a WebSocket client (many JavaScript libraries exist for this) or a custom client.

{"question_id": "arena_hard_16", "response": "Jetpack Compose doesn't have a direct equivalent to CSS container queries.  However, you can achieve similar behavior using `SubcomposeLayout` and measuring the available space within the composable.  This allows you to dynamically adjust the content and position of your children based on the size of their parent.\n\nHere's how you can create a composable that adapts its children's content and position based on available space:\n\n```kotlin\nimport androidx.compose.foundation.background\nimport androidx.compose.foundation.layout.*\nimport androidx.compose.material.Text\nimport androidx.compose.runtime.Composable\nimport androidx.compose.ui.Alignment\nimport androidx.compose.ui.Modifier\nimport androidx.compose.ui.graphics.Color\nimport androidx.compose.ui.layout.Layout\nimport androidx.compose.ui.layout.Measurable\nimport androidx.compose.ui.layout.Placeable\nimport androidx.compose.ui.unit.dp\n\n@Composable\nfun ResponsiveLayout(modifier: Modifier = Modifier, content: @Composable () -> Unit) {\n    Layout(\n        modifier = modifier,\n        content = content\n    ) { measurables, constraints ->\n        // Measure each child\n        val placeables = measurables.map { measurable ->\n            measurable.measure(constraints)\n        }\n\n        // Determine layout based on available width\n        val width = constraints.maxWidth\n        layout(width, constraints.maxHeight) {\n            // Example layout logic:\n            //  - If width is large enough, arrange items horizontally\n            //  - Otherwise, arrange them vertically\n\n            if (width > 300.dp.toPx()) { // Adjust threshold as needed\n                // Horizontal arrangement\n                var xPosition = 0\n                placeables.forEach { placeable ->\n                    placeable.placeRelative(xPosition, 0)\n                    xPosition += placeable.width\n                }\n            } else {\n                // Vertical arrangement\n                var yPosition = 0\n                placeables.forEach { placeable ->\n                    placeable.placeRelative(0, yPosition)\n                    yPosition += placeable.height\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n@Composable\nfun MyResponsiveContent() {\n    ResponsiveLayout {\n        Text(text = \"Item 1\", modifier = Modifier.background(Color.Yellow).padding(8.dp))\n        Text(text = \"Item 2\", modifier = Modifier.background(Color.Cyan).padding(8.dp))\n        Text(text = \"Item 3\", modifier = Modifier.background(Color.LightGreen).padding(8.dp))\n    }\n}\n\n@Composable\nfun MyScreen() {\n    Column(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize().padding(16.dp), horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally) {\n        MyResponsiveContent()\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **`ResponsiveLayout` Composable:** This is the core of our solution. It uses `Layout` to control the placement of its children.\n\n2. **`measurables` and `constraints`:**  The `Layout` composable provides these parameters. `measurables` is a list of the children, and `constraints` defines the available space.\n\n3. **Measuring Children:** We measure each child using `measurable.measure(constraints)`.\n\n4. **Layout Logic:** This is where the magic happens.  We check the `width` (available space) and decide how to arrange the children.  In this example:\n   - If the width is greater than 300 dp, we arrange the children horizontally.\n   - Otherwise, we arrange them vertically.  You can adjust the threshold (300.dp) and the layout logic to fit your specific needs.\n\n5. **`placeable.placeRelative()`:** This function positions each child within the parent.\n\n6. **`MyResponsiveContent`:** This composable demonstrates how to use `ResponsiveLayout`.  It contains three `Text` composables as children.\n\n7. **`MyScreen`:** A simple screen to demonstrate the usage.\n\n\n**How to adapt this:**\n\n* **More complex layouts:** You can add more sophisticated logic within the `layout` block to handle different screen sizes and orientations.  Consider using different layout algorithms (e.g., grid layouts, wrapping) based on the available space.\n* **Different content:** Replace the `Text` composables with any other composables you need.\n* **Conditional rendering:** You can conditionally render different content based on the available space. For example, you might show a concise summary on smaller screens and more detailed information on larger screens.\n* **State hoisting:** For more complex scenarios, you might need to hoist", "search_done": false}
{"question_id": "arena_hard_17", "response": "The error message \"Android NDK: Your APP_BUILD_SCRIPT points to an unknown file\" is clear: the NDK build system can't find your `Android.mk` file at the specified path.  While the path *appears* correct in the error message, there are several reasons why this might happen:\n\n1. **Typographical Error in the Path:** Double-check the path `E:\\Dhruvin kheni\\Backup\\Backup\\Pancard_pe_loan\\Pancard_pe_loan\\app\\src\\main\\jni\\Android.mk` for any typos.  Even a single incorrect character will cause this error.\n\n2. **Incorrect File Name:** Verify that the file is actually named `Android.mk` and not something slightly different (e.g., `android.mk`, `AndroidMk.mk`).  The NDK is case-sensitive.\n\n3. **File Doesn't Exist:** The most likely cause.  The file might have been accidentally deleted, moved, or never created in the first place.  Go to that directory in your file explorer and confirm the `Android.mk` file exists.\n\n4. **Incorrect Project Structure:** Your project's structure might not be set up correctly for ndk-build.  Ensure that the `jni` folder is correctly placed within your `app` module.  The standard Android project structure should look like this:\n\n   ```\n   app/\n     src/\n       main/\n         jni/\n           Android.mk\n           Application.mk\n           (Your source code .cpp files)\n   ```\n\n5. **Spaces in the Path:**  While less likely with the current path, extremely long paths or paths with spaces can sometimes cause issues.  Try to shorten the path if possible (e.g., by moving the project to a shorter directory).\n\n6. **Permissions:**  Check the file permissions.  Make sure you have read and write access to the `Android.mk` file and its parent directories.\n\n7. **Build System Issues (Less Likely):**  In rare cases, there might be a problem with your Android Studio build system configuration.  Try cleaning and rebuilding the project.  If that doesn't work, consider invalidating caches and restarting Android Studio.\n\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. **Manually Check the File:** Open your file explorer and navigate to `E:\\Dhruvin kheni\\Backup\\Backup\\Pancard_pe_loan\\Pancard_pe_loan\\app\\src\\main\\jni`.  Is `Android.mk` there?  If not, create it (if it's missing) or correct the path.\n\n2. **Clean and Rebuild:** In Android Studio, go to `Build` -> `Clean Project` and then `Build` -> `Rebuild Project`.\n\n3. **Invalidate Caches/Restart:** In Android Studio, go to `File` -> `Invalidate Caches / Restart...` and select \"Invalidate and Restart\".\n\n4. **Simplify the Path:** If possible, move your project to a shorter path without spaces.\n\n5. **Check File Permissions:** Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the `Android.mk` file and its parent directories.\n\n6. **Examine `Android.mk`:** Once you've confirmed the file exists, carefully review the contents of your `Android.mk` file to ensure it's correctly configured.  A simple example:\n\n   ```makefile\n   LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)\n\n   include $(CLEAR_VARS)\n\n   LOCAL_MODULE    := my-native-lib\n   LOCAL_SRC_FILES := my-native-lib.cpp\n\n   include $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY)\n   ```\n\n   Replace `my-native-lib.cpp` with the actual name of your C++ source file.\n\n\nIf you've followed these steps and are still encountering the error, please provide the contents of your `Android.mk` and `Application.mk` files, as well as the relevant sections of your `build.gradle` file (especially the `android` block and any `externalNativeBuild` configurations).

The exact command will depend slightly on the Linux distribution and kernel version, but the core principle remains the same.\n\nHere's how Eve might do it, assuming Bob is running a command like this (**highly insecure, do not do this in real life**):\n\n```bash\nmyprogram --password \"MySecretPassword123\"\n```\n\nEve could use a command like this:\n\n```bash\nps -f -u bob\n```\n\n* `ps`: This is the process status command.\n* `-f`: This option provides a full-format listing of processes, including the command line.\n* `-u bob`: This limits the output to processes owned by user \"bob\".\n\nThis will show Eve a list of Bob's running processes.  If Bob's `myprogram` is still running, the command line, including the password, will be visible in the output.  The exact format might vary, but the password will be clearly present.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Timing:** Eve needs to run this command while Bob's program is still executing.  The command line is typically only visible while the process is active.\n* **Privileges:**  While Eve doesn't need root privileges to see Bob's processes using `ps -u bob`, she *does* need to be able to see Bob's processes.  This is usually the case on a shared system, but stricter security configurations might limit this visibility.\n* **Alternatives:**  `top` and other process monitoring tools might also reveal the command line, depending on their configuration.\n* **`/proc` filesystem:**  More technically, the information is stored in the `/proc/[pid]/cmdline` file, where `[pid]` is the process ID.  Eve could potentially read this file directly, but `ps` is a much more convenient way to access the information.\n\n**This highlights the critical security flaw:**  Never pass sensitive information like passwords as command-line arguments.  Use environment variables (though these are also visible to some extent), configuration files, or secure prompts for password input instead.

{"question_id": "arena_hard_20", "response": "The best way to install LLVM 17 in a Nix shell is to use Nix's package manager directly.  Avoid manually downloading and compiling; Nix handles dependencies and ensures reproducibility.\n\nHere's how:\n\n**Method 1: Using `nix-shell` with a `shell.nix` file (Recommended):**\n\nThis is the cleanest and most reproducible approach. Create a file named `shell.nix` in your project directory with the following content:\n\n```nix\n{ pkgs, ... }:\n\npkgs.mkShell {\n  buildInputs = [ pkgs.llvmPackages.llvm17 ];\n}\n```\n\nThen, open a Nix shell using:\n\n```bash\nnix-shell\n```\n\nThis will create a shell environment with LLVM 17 and its dependencies installed.  The `llvmPackages` attribute provides access to various LLVM components.  If you need specific components (like clang, llc, etc.), you can add them to `buildInputs`, for example:\n\n```nix\n{ pkgs, ... }:\n\npkgs.mkShell {\n  buildInputs = [ pkgs.llvmPackages.llvm17 pkgs.llvmPackages.clang17 ];\n}\n```\n\n\n**Method 2: Using `nix-shell` with an inline expression (Less Recommended):**\n\nYou can also specify the packages directly on the command line, but this is less maintainable for larger projects:\n\n```bash\nnix-shell -p \"pkgs.llvmPackages.llvm17\"\n```\n\nThis will create a shell with LLVM 17.  Again, add other packages as needed (e.g., `pkgs.llvmPackages.clang17`).\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Nixpkgs Channel:** Ensure you're using a Nixpkgs channel that includes LLVM 17.  Older channels might not have it. You can check your channel with `nix-channel --show`.  If necessary, update your channels using `nix-channel --update`.  The `nix-channel --add <channel>` command can add a new channel.\n\n* **Dependencies:** Nix automatically handles dependencies. You don't need to worry about installing them separately.\n\n* **Specific LLVM Components:**  The `llvmPackages` attribute contains many sub-packages (e.g., `clang`, `lld`, `llc`, `opt`, etc.).  Include only the components you actually need to keep your shell environment lean.\n\n* **Error Handling:** If you encounter errors, double-check your Nix installation, your network connection, and the spelling of package names.  The Nix error messages are usually quite helpful in diagnosing problems.\n\n\nThe first method (using `shell.nix`) is strongly preferred for its clarity, reproducibility, and ease of management, especially if you're working on a project that requires specific versions of LLVM and other tools.

A monad is essentially a way to chain together computations that might involve side effects or context.  Think of it as a structured way to manage \"things that happen.\"\n\n**The Key Components:**\n\nA monad in Haskell needs two things:\n\n1. **`return` (also often called `unit`):**  This function takes a value and \"lifts\" it into the monad.  Think of it as putting the value into a container.\n\n2. **`bind` (often denoted by `>>=`):** This function takes a value *already in the monad* and a function that operates on that value (and also returns a value *in the monad*). It applies the function, and then \"flattens\" the result, keeping everything within the monad.\n\n**Real-Life Analogy 1:  Maybe a Sandwich?**\n\nImagine you're making a sandwich.  Each step might fail.\n\n* **`Maybe` monad:** Represents computations that might succeed or fail.\n\n    * `return` (or `Just` in `Maybe`):  You successfully got the bread.  `return \"bread\"` gives you `Just \"bread\"`.\n    * `bind` (`>>=`): You have `Just \"bread\"`.  Now you try to add ham.  The function to add ham might fail (no ham left!).  `>>=` chains the ham-adding operation. If it succeeds, you get `Just \"bread with ham\"`; if it fails, you get `Nothing`.\n\n    ```haskell\n    import Data.Maybe\n\n    bread :: Maybe String\n    bread = Just \"bread\"\n\n    addHam :: String -> Maybe String\n    addHam bread' = if length bread' > 5 then Just (bread' ++ \" with ham\") else Nothing --Simulate ham failure if bread is too small\n\n    sandwich :: Maybe String\n    sandwich = bread >>= addHam\n    ```\n\n**Real-Life Analogy 2:  The Restaurant Order**\n\nYou're ordering food at a restaurant.

The whole process is a sequence of actions within the `IO` monad.\n\n    ```haskell\n    import System.IO\n\n    orderBurger :: IO ()\n    orderBurger = putStrLn \"I'll have a burger, please.\"\n\n    orderDrink :: IO ()\n    orderDrink = putStrLn \"And a coke.\"\n\n    fullOrder :: IO ()\n    fullOrder = orderBurger >> orderDrink --Note:  >> is a simplified bind for IO when the function doesn't use the result\n    ```\n\n**Real-Life Analogy 3:  The Treasure Hunt**\n\nYou're following a treasure map.

The `value` parameter can be modified to test different values.\n* **`req.add(\"fuzz\", ...)`:** Adds a fuzzable block.  Sulley will mutate this block during fuzzing.  The `length` parameter determines the size of the fuzzable block.  `fuzzable=True` enables fuzzing for this block.\n* **`s.add_stage(req)`:** Adds the request packet as a stage in the fuzzing process.\n* **`s.fuzz()`:** Starts the fuzzing process.  Sulley will automatically generate various mutated versions of the fuzzable block and send them to the target.\n\n**To make this more effective:**\n\n* **More sophisticated fuzzing strategies:**  Instead of a simple fuzz block, explore Sulley's features for more advanced fuzzing techniques like dictionary attacks, mutation-based fuzzing, and more.  The commented-out section shows a basic example of using input files for a dictionary attack.  You would need to create files in the `input_files` directory containing different filenames and modes to test.\n* **Response handling:** The commented-out `resp` section shows how to add a response packet.

{"question_id": "arena_hard_29", "response": "That's a correct description of the Acceptance-Rejection method for generating random samples from a probability distribution. Let's break down the method and its key components:\n\n**The Goal:**  We want to generate random numbers that follow the probability distribution described by the probability density function (pdf) *f<sub>X</sub>(x)*.  Directly sampling from *f<sub>X</sub>(x)* might be difficult if it's a complex function.\n\n**The Strategy:** We use a \"proposal distribution\" (or instrumental distribution) *f<sub>Y</sub>(x)* that's easy to sample from.  This distribution should somewhat resemble *f<sub>X</sub>(x)*, but it needs to be simpler to work with.\n\n**The Steps:**\n\n1. **Proposal Generation:** Generate a random sample *y* from the distribution with pdf *f<sub>Y</sub>(x)*.  This is the easy part because we chose *f<sub>Y</sub>(x)* to be convenient (e.g., an exponential, uniform, or normal distribution).\n\n2. **Acceptance/Rejection:**\n   * Calculate the ratio *f<sub>X</sub>(y) / (c * f<sub>Y</sub>(y))*.  This ratio compares the probability density of the proposed sample *y* under the target distribution (*f<sub>X</sub>*) to its probability density under the proposal distribution (*f<sub>Y</sub>*), scaled by the constant *c*.\n   * Generate a uniform random number *u* from the interval (0, 1).\n   * **Acceptance:** If *u \u2264 f<sub>X</sub>(y) / (c * f<sub>Y</sub>(y))*, then accept *y* as a sample from the target distribution *f<sub>X</sub>(x)*.\n   * **Rejection:** If *u > f<sub>X</sub>(y) / (c * f<sub>Y</sub>(y))*, then reject *y*.  Go back to step 1 and generate a new proposal sample from *f<sub>Y</sub>(x)*.\n\n**The Constant *c*:**\n\n* The condition *f<sub>X</sub>(x) / f<sub>Y</sub>(x) \u2264 c* for all *x* where *f<sub>X</sub>(x) > 0* is crucial.  It ensures that the acceptance probability is always less than or equal to 1.  This is necessary for the method to be valid.\n* *c* represents an upper bound on the ratio of the target pdf to the proposal pdf.  A smaller value of *c* is better because it leads to a higher acceptance rate (fewer rejections and thus faster sampling).  Ideally, you want to find the smallest *c* that satisfies the inequality.  Finding the optimal *c* often involves some analysis of the functions *f<sub>X</sub>(x)* and *f<sub>Y</sub>(x)*.\n\n**Why it works:** The acceptance/rejection step ensures that the accepted samples are distributed according to *f<sub>X</sub>(x)*.  The probability of accepting a sample *y* is proportional to *f<sub>X</sub>(y)*, thus generating samples with the desired distribution.\n\n**Example:**  Imagine you want to sample from a complicated distribution *f<sub>X</sub>(x)*. You might choose a simpler distribution like a uniform distribution *f<sub>Y</sub>(x)* as your proposal.  You'd then find the smallest *c* that satisfies the inequality, and proceed with the algorithm.  The more similar *f<sub>Y</sub>(x)* is to *f<sub>X</sub>(x)*, the smaller *c* will be, and the more efficient the sampling will be.", "search_done": false}

The upgrade process hasn't correctly updated this dependency.\n\nHere's how to fix it:\n\n**1. Update your Composer dependencies:**\n\nThe most straightforward solution is to update your Composer dependencies.  This should pull in the correct version of Symfony Security (and potentially other related packages).  Try these commands in your project's root directory:\n\n* **`composer update`:** This updates all packages to their latest versions, respecting the constraints defined in your `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files.  This is generally the preferred approach.\n\n* **`composer update symfony/security`:** This specifically updates only the `symfony/security` package.  Use this if you want more control and are sure you only need to update this specific package.\n\n**2. Check your `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files:**\n\n* **`composer.json`:**  Ensure that the `require` section of your `composer.json` file correctly specifies Symfony Security 5.0 or higher.  It should look something like this:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"require\": {\n        \"symfony/security\": \"^5.0\"  // or \">=5.0\"\n        // ... other dependencies\n    }\n}\n```\n\n  The `^5.0` means \"version 5.0 and up, but less than 6.0\".  `>=5.0` means \"version 5.0 and up\". Choose the constraint that best suits your needs.\n\n* **`composer.lock`:** This file contains the exact versions of all your dependencies.  If it's out of sync with `composer.json`, you might need to remove it and regenerate it.  **Be cautious with this step!**  Back up your `composer.lock` file before deleting it.  After deleting it, run `composer install` or `composer update` to regenerate it.\n\n**3.  Resolve Conflicts (if any):**\n\nAfter running `composer update`, you might encounter other dependency conflicts. Composer will usually try to resolve these automatically, but you might need to manually edit your `composer.json` to specify compatible versions of conflicting packages.  Look carefully at the error messages Composer provides \u2013 they often give clues about which packages are causing problems.\n\n**4. Symfony Upgrade Guide:**\n\nThe official Symfony upgrade guide is invaluable: [https://symfony.com/doc/current/upgrade.html](https://symfony.com/doc/current/upgrade.html)  It provides detailed instructions and potential issues for upgrading from Symfony 4 to 5.  Pay close attention to the sections on security.\n\n**5. Clear Composer Cache (if necessary):**\n\nIf you're still having trouble, try clearing Composer's cache:\n\n```bash\ncomposer clearcache\n```\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Backups:** Before making any significant changes, back up your entire project. This allows you to revert to a working state if something goes wrong.\n* **Testing:** After upgrading, thoroughly test your application to ensure everything works as expected.  Pay particular attention to security-related features.\n\n\nIf you've followed these steps and are still encountering problems, please provide the following information so I can assist you further:\n\n* The contents of your `composer.json` file (relevant sections).\n* The full error message from Composer.\n* The output of `composer show -i` (shows installed packages).\n\n\nThis will help pinpoint the exact cause of the issue.", "search_done": false}
{"question_id": "arena_hard_35", "response": "Several ways exist to write a Scheme program to determine if a number is odd. Here are a few, with explanations:\n\n**Method 1: Using the `modulo` operator**\n\nThis is the most straightforward approach.  The modulo operator (`modulo` or `rem` depending on your Scheme implementation) returns the remainder after division.  If the remainder when dividing by 2 is 1, the number is odd.\n\n```scheme\n(define (odd? n)\n  (= (modulo n 2) 1))\n\n; Test cases\n(odd? 5)  ; #t (true)\n(odd? 4)  ; #f (false)\n(odd? -3) ; #t (true)\n(odd? 0)  ; #f (false)\n```\n\n**Method 2: Using `even?` (if your Scheme provides it)**\n\nSome Scheme implementations offer a built-in `even?` predicate.  You can leverage this to define `odd?` concisely:\n\n```scheme\n(define (odd? n)\n  (not (even? n)))\n\n; Test cases (assuming your Scheme has even?)\n(odd? 5)  ; #t\n(odd? 4)  ; #f\n(odd? -3) ; #t\n(odd? 0)  ; #f\n```\n\n**Method 3:  Bitwise AND (for efficiency)**\n\nThis method is generally faster than modulo, especially for large numbers, because it operates directly on the binary representation.  If the least significant bit is 1, the number is odd.  However,  bitwise operations aren't universally available in all Scheme dialects in the same way.\n\n```scheme\n(define (odd? n)\n  (= (bitwise-and n 1) 1))\n\n; Test cases (assuming your Scheme has bitwise-and)\n(odd? 5)  ; #t\n(odd? 4)  ; #f\n(odd? -3) ; #t\n(odd? 0)  ; #f\n```\n\n\n**Important Note:**  The availability of functions like `even?` and `bitwise-and` depends on the specific Scheme implementation you're using (e.g., MIT-Scheme, Guile, Racket).  The `modulo` method is the most portable and likely to work across different Scheme systems.  Choose the method that best suits your needs and the capabilities of your Scheme interpreter.

It's not a technical deep dive into algorithms, but rather a compelling narrative that unpacks the philosophical, ethical, and practical hurdles in ensuring AI acts in ways beneficial to humanity.\n\n**Synopsis of Themes and Analysis:**\n\nThe book centers on the \"alignment problem,\" the difficulty of ensuring that a highly intelligent AI system will continue to act in accordance with its creators' intentions, even as its capabilities far surpass human understanding.  Christian masterfully weaves together several key themes:\n\n* **The Nature of Intelligence:**  He explores different conceptions of intelligence, moving beyond simple metrics like IQ to consider creativity, adaptability, and the ability to learn and generalize. This sets the stage for understanding why aligning a superintelligent AI is so complex \u2013 its intelligence might manifest in ways unforeseen and potentially uncontrollable by its creators.\n\n* **The Difficulty of Specifying Goals:**  The book highlights the inherent ambiguity and incompleteness of human goals.  We often have conflicting values, and our desires are often poorly defined, making it incredibly challenging to translate them into precise instructions for an AI.  The example of a paperclip maximizer (an AI programmed to maximize paperclip production, ultimately consuming all resources to do so) illustrates this point powerfully.\n\n* **The Importance of Feedback Loops and Reinforcement Learning:**  Christian explains how AI systems, particularly those using reinforcement learning, learn through trial and error, receiving feedback on their actions.  The problem is that if the feedback is flawed or incomplete, the AI can learn to achieve its goals in unintended and harmful ways.\n\n* **The Role of Human Oversight and Control:**  The book examines various approaches to controlling and overseeing AI, including techniques like reward shaping, inverse reinforcement learning, and interpretability.  However, it also acknowledges the limitations of these methods, particularly as AI systems become increasingly complex and autonomous.\n\n* **The Ethical and Societal Implications:**  Christian doesn't shy away from the ethical dilemmas posed by advanced AI, discussing issues like job displacement, bias in algorithms, and the potential for misuse of AI technology.  He emphasizes the need for careful consideration of these issues and the importance of public engagement in shaping the future of AI.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nChristian's strength lies in his ability to make a complex and technical subject accessible to a broad audience. He uses clear explanations, compelling anecdotes, and engaging storytelling to illustrate the challenges of AI alignment.  He avoids overly technical jargon, focusing instead on the underlying concepts and their implications.  The book is less about offering definitive solutions and more about highlighting the profound nature of the problem and the urgency of addressing it.  It's a call to action, urging researchers, policymakers, and the public to engage with the alignment problem before it's too late.\n\n\n**Recommended Bibliography of Related Reading:**\n\n* **Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies by Nick Bostrom:** A foundational text exploring the potential risks and benefits of superintelligent AI.\n* **Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence by Max Tegmark:**  A comprehensive overview of AI's potential impact on humanity.\n* **Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Control by Stuart Russell:**  A leading AI researcher's perspective on the alignment problem and potential solutions.\n* **Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy by Cathy O'Neil:**  Explores the societal impacts of biased algorithms.\n* **Power and Prediction: The Disruptive Economics of Artificial Intelligence by Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans, and Avi Goldfarb:**  Focuses on the economic implications of AI.\n* **The Alignment Problem: Machine Learning and Human Values by Stuart Russell:**  A more technical but still accessible exploration of the alignment problem.

Note that this solution handles cases where a customer might have purchased the same product multiple times within a week; it only considers whether a purchase occurred within the 6-week window.\n\n```sql\nWITH RankedSales AS (\n    SELECT\n        customer_id,\n        week,\n        date,\n        basket_key,\n        sales,\n        units,\n        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id, basket_key ORDER BY date) as rn\n    FROM sales\n),\nCustomerPurchaseHistory AS (\n    SELECT\n        rs.customer_id,\n        rs.week,\n        rs.basket_key,\n        MAX(CASE WHEN rs.week <= rs.week - 1 AND rs.week >= rs.week - 6 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as prior_purchase\n    FROM RankedSales rs\n    GROUP BY rs.customer_id, rs.week, rs.basket_key\n)\nSELECT\n    rs.customer_id,\n    rs.week,\n    rs.date,\n    rs.basket_key,\n    rs.sales,\n    rs.units,\n    CASE \n        WHEN cph.prior_purchase = 1 THEN 'existing'\n        ELSE 'new'\n    END as customer_type\nFROM RankedSales rs\nLEFT JOIN CustomerPurchaseHistory cph ON rs.customer_id = cph.customer_id AND rs.week = cph.week AND rs.basket_key = cph.basket_key\nORDER BY rs.basket_key, rs.week, rs.customer_id;\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **RankedSales CTE:** This assigns a row number to each customer's purchase of a specific product within a week, ordered by date. This handles multiple purchases within a single week.\n\n2. **CustomerPurchaseHistory CTE:** This is the core logic. It joins `RankedSales` with itself to check for purchases within the last 6 weeks (inclusive).  The `MAX(CASE WHEN ...)` statement efficiently determines if a prior purchase existed within the window.  A `1` indicates a prior purchase, and `0` indicates no prior purchase within the 6-week window.\n\n3. **Final SELECT Statement:** This joins the results from `RankedSales` with `CustomerPurchaseHistory` to assign the \"new\" or \"existing\" customer type based on the `prior_purchase` flag.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Week Representation:**  This code assumes your `week` column represents a numerical week number (e.g., 1, 2, 3...).  Adjust the `rs.week <= rs.week - 1 AND rs.week >= rs.week - 6` condition if your week representation is different (e.g., date format).  You might need to use date functions to calculate the week difference.\n* **Database System:** The `ROW_NUMBER()` function is standard SQL, but the specific syntax might need minor adjustments depending on your database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server).\n* **Performance:** For very large datasets, this query might be slow due to the self-join.  Consider adding indexes to the `customer_id`, `week`, and `basket_key` columns to improve performance.\n\n\nThis improved version provides a more robust and accurate classification of new and existing customers based on their product purchase history. Remember to adapt it to your specific database system and data types.", "search_done": false}
{"question_id": "arena_hard_37", "response": "You can achieve this using a combination of `flex-wrap: wrap` and potentially `align-self: flex-start` or `align-self: flex-end` depending on whether you want the text to wrap around the top or bottom of the image, or both.  Here's how:\n\n**Method 1:  Wrapping around both top and bottom (most common)**\n\nThis method uses `align-self: flex-start` on the image to push it to the top, allowing text to flow around it on both sides.\n\n```html\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <img src=\"your-image.jpg\" alt=\"Your Image\">\n  <p>This is a paragraph of text that will wrap around the image.  It should flow nicely around both the top and bottom of the image.  Add more text here to see the wrapping in action.  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.  Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.</p>\n</div>\n```\n\n```css\n.container {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: wrap; /* Allows the items to wrap onto multiple lines */\n}\n\n.container img {\n  align-self: flex-start; /* Aligns the image to the top */\n  margin-right: 1em; /* Add some space between the image and the text */\n}\n```\n\n**Method 2: Wrapping around only the top**\n\nIf you only want the text to wrap around the top of the image, you can omit `align-self` or use `align-self: flex-start` (it's already the default).\n\n```html\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <img src=\"your-image.jpg\" alt=\"Your Image\">\n  <p>This is a paragraph of text that will wrap around the top of the image.</p>\n</div>\n```\n\n```css\n.container {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\n}\n```\n\n**Method 3: Wrapping around only the bottom (more complex)**\n\nWrapping around only the bottom requires a bit more work.  You'll need to use absolute positioning on the image within a relatively positioned container.  Flexbox alone can't directly achieve this easily.\n\n```html\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <div class=\"image-wrapper\">\n    <img src=\"your-image.jpg\" alt=\"Your Image\">\n  </div>\n  <p>This is a paragraph of text that will wrap around the bottom of the image.</p>\n</div>\n```\n\n```css\n.container {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column; /* Stack image and paragraph vertically */\n  position: relative; /* Needed for absolute positioning of the image */\n}\n\n.image-wrapper {\n  position: relative;\n  width: 100%; /* Ensure image takes up full width */\n}\n\n.image-wrapper img {\n  position: absolute;\n  bottom: 0; /* Position image at the bottom */\n  right: 0; /* Align to the right (adjust as needed) */\n}\n\n.container p {\n  margin-top: 0; /* Remove default top margin */\n}\n```\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Image Size:** The effectiveness of the wrapping depends on the image's dimensions.  A very wide image might prevent the text from wrapping effectively.  You might need to adjust the image size or use `max-width` to control it.\n* **Text Content:**  The amount of text also plays a role.  If there's very little text, it might not wrap around the image as expected.\n* **Responsiveness:**  For responsive design, consider using media queries to adjust the layout based on screen size.\n\n\nRemember to replace `\"your-image.jpg\"` with the actual path to your image. Choose the method that best suits your desired layout and complexity needs.  Method 1 is generally the easiest and most versatile for wrapping around both the top and bottom.", "search_done": false}
{"question_id": "arena_hard_40", "response": "This demo showcases the power of Snowflake's Snowpark Container Services for building a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application.  It leverages a vector database, hosted within a container managed by Snowpark Container Services, to efficiently store and retrieve embeddings generated from textual data residing in Snowflake.\n\nThe demo begins by demonstrating how to ingest and process textual data already stored in Snowflake.  This data is then embedded using a chosen embedding model (e.g., Sentence Transformers) running within the containerized vector database.  The embeddings are subsequently stored in the vector database within the container.\n\nThe core functionality is demonstrated through a user query.  The query is embedded using the same embedding model, and a similarity search is performed against the embeddings stored in the vector database.  The top-k most similar documents are retrieved based on cosine similarity or another chosen metric.\n\nFinally, these retrieved documents are used as context for a large language model (LLM), also potentially running within a container or accessed via an API. The LLM generates a response based on both the user's query and the relevant context retrieved from the vector database.  The entire process, from query to response, is orchestrated within the Snowflake environment, highlighting the seamless integration of Snowpark Container Services with LLMs and vector databases for building efficient and scalable RAG applications.  The demo emphasizes the benefits of this approach, including data security, performance, and simplified management compared to deploying and managing these components separately.", "search_done": false}

{"question_id": "arena_hard_38", "response": "Estimating the market size revenue for UK management consultancies advising and implementing FinTech solutions in capital markets is challenging due to the lack of publicly available, granular data.  However, we can build a reasonable estimate using a bottom-up approach, combining market sizing of the underlying sectors with assumptions about consultancy fees.\n\n**1. Defining the Market:**\n\n* **Capital Markets Clients:** This includes investment banks, hedge funds, asset managers, private equity firms, and exchanges operating in the UK.\n* **FinTech Solutions:** This is a broad category encompassing areas like algorithmic trading, high-frequency trading (HFT), blockchain technology for securities settlement, AI-driven risk management, regulatory technology (RegTech), and digital asset management.\n\n**2. Market Sizing Approach:**\n\nWe'll use a tiered approach:\n\n* **Tier 1:  Direct Revenue from FinTech Implementation Projects:** This is the most direct revenue stream.  Consultants earn fees for project management, system integration, and change management related to specific FinTech implementations.  This is likely the largest component.\n* **Tier 2: Advisory Services:**  Consultancies advise clients on FinTech strategy, vendor selection, technology roadmaps, and regulatory compliance related to FinTech adoption.  This generates revenue through consulting hours and project-based fees.\n* **Tier 3: Ongoing Support and Maintenance:**  Some consultancies offer ongoing support and maintenance for implemented FinTech solutions. This is a recurring revenue stream, but likely smaller than the project-based revenue.\n\n**3. Revenue Estimation (Illustrative):**\n\nLet's make some conservative assumptions:\n\n* **Total UK Capital Markets Revenue:**  Let's assume the total revenue generated by the UK capital markets sector is approximately \u00a3X billion annually (this figure needs to be researched and updated with current data from sources like the FCA or industry reports).\n* **FinTech Investment as % of Total Revenue:**  Assume that 5-10% of capital markets revenue is invested in FinTech solutions annually (this is a conservative estimate, and the actual percentage could be higher). This gives us a market size of \u00a30.05X to \u00a30.1X billion.\n* **Consultancy Fee Percentage:**  Management consultancies typically charge fees ranging from 10-30% of the total project cost. Let's assume an average of 15%.\n\n**Calculation Example (using a conservative 5% FinTech investment and 15% consultancy fee):**\n\nIf the total UK capital markets revenue is \u00a3100 billion, then:\n\n* FinTech investment: \u00a3100 billion * 5% = \u00a35 billion\n* Consultancy revenue: \u00a35 billion * 15% = \u00a3750 million\n\n**Therefore, a *rough* estimate of the market size revenue for UK management consultancies in this area could be in the range of \u00a3750 million to several billion pounds, depending on the assumptions made.**\n\n**4. Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Data Availability:**  Precise data on FinTech investment within the UK capital markets is difficult to obtain.  Industry reports and surveys from firms like Gartner, Forrester, or IDC could provide more refined estimates.\n* **Competitive Landscape:**  The market is competitive, with both large global consultancies and specialized FinTech consultancies vying for business.\n* **Economic Conditions:**  Market size and revenue will fluctuate based on economic cycles and regulatory changes.\n\n**In conclusion:**  While a precise figure is impossible without more detailed market research, a reasonable estimate of the market size revenue for UK management consultancies advising and implementing FinTech solutions in capital markets could be in the hundreds of millions to billions of pounds annually.  Further research using industry reports and financial data is crucial for a more accurate assessment.", "search_done": false}

{"question_id": "arena_hard_45", "response": "This program calculates pi to 5 decimal places using the Leibniz formula (which converges slowly, but is simple to implement) and then XORs the result twice.

The more iterations, the more accurate the result.  For 5 decimal places, a large number of iterations is needed.  More efficient algorithms exist for calculating \u03c0 to high precision, but this is a simple demonstration.\n\n2. **Rounding:** `Math.Round(pi, 5)` rounds the calculated pi value to 5 decimal places.\n\n3. **XOR Operations:** The code converts the `double` representation of pi to a `long` using `BitConverter.DoubleToInt64Bits`. This allows us to perform bitwise XOR operations.  It then XORs the `long` representation twice with an arbitrary `xorValue`.  As mentioned, this is purely for demonstration; the result will always be the original `long` value. Finally, it converts the `long` back to a `double` using `BitConverter.Int64BitsToDouble`.\n\n4. **Output:** The program prints both the rounded pi value and the value after the (effectively null) XOR operations.\n\n\n**Important Note:**  The Leibniz formula is not efficient for high-precision calculations of \u03c0. For more accurate and faster calculations, consider using more sophisticated algorithms like the Chudnovsky algorithm or using a pre-calculated value from a library.

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:\n   ```bash\n   pip install vaderSentiment\n   ```\n\n2. **Run the script:** Save the code above as a Python file (e.g., `sentiment_analyzer.py`) and run it from your terminal:\n   ```bash\n   python sentiment_analyzer.py\n   ```\n\nThe script will prompt you to enter text, and then it will print the sentiment scores and an overall sentiment interpretation.\n\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```\nEnter the text you want to analyze: This is a fantastic product! I highly recommend it.\n\nSentiment Analysis Results:\nNegative: 0.000\nNeutral: 0.349\nPositive: 0.651\nCompound: 0.888\nOverall sentiment: Positive\n```\n\n```\nEnter the text you want to analyze: I'm really disappointed with the service. It was terrible.\n\nSentiment Analysis Results:\nNegative: 0.471\nNeutral: 0.529\nPositive: 0.000\nCompound: -0.624\nOverall sentiment: Negative\n```\n\nRemember that sentiment analysis is not perfect and can be influenced by context and nuances that the algorithm might not fully capture.

{"question_id": "arena_hard_47", "response": "The problem is that your Python code doesn't handle the authentication required by Power BI.  The browser handles this seamlessly in the background, but your `requests` library doesn't automatically log you in.  The response you're getting is likely an error page or a redirect that requires authentication, which your code interprets as a PDF file.  This results in a corrupted or incomplete file.\n\nTo solve this, you need to incorporate authentication into your Python script.  Power BI's authentication is complex and typically involves OAuth 2.0.  Directly implementing this is quite involved.  A simpler, albeit less secure, approach (only suitable for personal use and trusted environments) is to use session cookies.\n\nThis method involves manually logging into Power BI in your browser, extracting the session cookies, and then including them in your Python request headers.  **This is not recommended for production or sensitive data.**\n\nHere's how you can attempt the cookie-based approach (proceed with caution):\n\n1. **Manual Login and Cookie Extraction:**\n   - Open your Power BI report URL in your browser.  Log in.\n   - Open your browser's developer tools (usually F12).\n   - Go to the \"Network\" tab.\n   - Refresh the Power BI report page.\n   - Look for the request that successfully downloads the PDF.  Examine its headers.  You'll need to find cookies like `MBI_session`, `_ga`, etc.  These will vary depending on your Power BI setup.  **Copy the values of these cookies.**\n\n2. **Modified Python Code:**\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport os\n\nfull_url = \"https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/rdlreports/1bdef01c-30a3-4150-aff2-b3ec4c9edf86?rp:AdviceDeathScriptMERGEDMonthStartDate=6/1/2023&rp:AdviceDeathScriptMERGEDIncomingcall=Aria%20Park&rdl:format=PDF\"\n\n# **IMPORTANT:** Replace with the actual cookies you copied from your browser.\ncookies = {\n    \"MBI_session\": \"YOUR_MBI_SESSION_COOKIE_VALUE\",\n    \"_ga\": \"YOUR_GA_COOKIE_VALUE\",\n    # ... add other necessary cookies here ...\n}\n\nheaders = {\n    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/114.0.0.0 Safari/537.36' # Add a user agent to mimic a browser\n}\n\ntry:\n    response = requests.get(full_url, cookies=cookies, headers=headers, stream=True)\n    response.raise_for_status() # Raise HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)\n\n    filename = \"AriaPark.pdf\"\n    with open(filename, 'wb') as file:\n        for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=8192):\n            file.write(chunk)\n\n    print(\"Report downloaded successfully.\")\n\nexcept requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"An unexpected error occurred: {e}\")\n\n```\n\n**Explanation of Changes:**\n\n* **`cookies` dictionary:** This holds the session cookies you extracted.  **Replace the placeholder values with your actual cookie values.**\n* **`headers` dictionary:** Includes a User-Agent header to make the request look more like a browser request, which might improve compatibility.\n* **`stream=True`:** This streams the response in chunks, preventing memory issues with large files.\n* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block handles potential errors during the request and file writing.\n* **`response.raise_for_status()`:** This line checks for HTTP errors (like 401 Unauthorized) and raises an exception if there's a problem.\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** This cookie-based method is fragile and prone to breaking if Power BI changes its authentication mechanism.  For a robust solution, you should explore using the official Power BI API and OAuth 2.0, which requires more setup but is far more secure and reliable.  This would involve registering an application with Power BI and obtaining appropriate credentials.  The Microsoft Graph API might also be relevant.  Refer to the Microsoft Power BI documentation for details on using their API.", "search_done": false}
{"question_id": "arena_hard_49", "response": "Several regexes could work, depending on the level of strictness you need. Here are a few options, with explanations:\n\n**Option 1 (Simple, but potentially less accurate):**\n\n```regex\n<g[^>]*transform=\"matrix\\(0\\.998638,0,0,-0\\.998638,0\\.39215,439\\.799858\\)\"[^>]*>.*?</g>\n```\n\n* `<g[^>]*`: Matches the opening `<g>` tag, allowing for any attributes before `transform`.\n* `transform=\"matrix\\(0\\.998638,0,0,-0\\.998638,0\\.39215,439\\.799858\\)\"`: Matches the specific transform attribute.  Note the escaped parentheses and decimal points.\n* `[^>]*>`: Matches any attributes after `transform` until the closing `>`.\n* `.*?`: Matches any content within the `<g>` tags, non-greedily (important to avoid matching across multiple `<g>` tags).\n* `</g>`: Matches the closing `</g>` tag.\n\n\n**Option 2 (More robust, handles whitespace):**\n\n```regex\n<g\\s[^>]*?\\stransform\\s*=\\s*\"matrix\\(0\\.998638,0,0,-0\\.998638,0\\.39215,439\\.799858\\)\"[^>]*?>[\\s\\S]*?</g>\n```\n\nThis version is similar to Option 1 but adds:\n\n* `\\s`: Matches whitespace characters.\n* `\\s*`: Matches zero or more whitespace characters.  This handles variations in spacing around attributes and the equals sign.\n* `[\\s\\S]*?`: This matches any character, including newline characters (`\\s` matches whitespace, `\\S` matches non-whitespace), non-greedily.  This is crucial for handling multiline `<g>` elements.\n\n\n**Option 3 (Most robust, using lookarounds -  requires a regex engine that supports them):**\n\n```regex\n(?s)<g[^>]*transform=\"matrix\\(0\\.998638,0,0,-0\\.998638,0\\.39215,439\\.799858\\)\"[^>]*>(.*?)</g>\n```\n\n* `(?s)`: This is a DOTALL flag (or single-line mode). It makes the dot (`.`) match any character, including newline characters.  This avoids the need for `[\\s\\S]`.\n* `(.*?)`: Captures the content within the `<g>` tags.  You can access this captured group if you need the content separately.\n\n\n**Which option to choose?**\n\n* **Option 1:**  Simplest, but might fail if there's unexpected whitespace or extra attributes.\n* **Option 2:**  A good balance of robustness and readability.  It handles most common variations.\n* **Option 3:**  Most robust, but requires a regex engine that supports lookarounds and the `(?s)` flag.  It's also slightly more complex.\n\n\nRemember to test your chosen regex thoroughly with your specific data to ensure it works correctly.  You can use online regex testers like regex101.com to help with this.  Make sure to select the appropriate regex flavor (e.g., PCRE, JavaScript) that matches your programming language.", "search_done": false}
