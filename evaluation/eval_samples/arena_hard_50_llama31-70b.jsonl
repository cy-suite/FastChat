Capsule networks are designed to handle \"entities\" or objects with clear boundaries and hierarchical relationships, which makes them well-suited for classification problems with well-defined entities, such as images of objects.\n\nIn contrast, problems like weather patterns, which involve complex, dynamic, and spatially varying phenomena, may not be as well-suited for capsule networks. Weather patterns often involve subtle, nuanced, and context-dependent relationships between variables, which can be challenging for capsule networks to capture.\n\nThat being said, it's worth noting that capsule networks are still a relatively new and evolving area of research, and it's possible that future developments could extend their applicability to more complex and nuanced problems like weather patterns.", "search_done": false}
{"question_id": "arena_hard_1", "response": "To parse a DataFrame in Python from a bytestream without downloading the whole file, you can use a combination of the `pandas` library and a streaming approach. This method is particularly useful when dealing with large files that don't fit into memory or when you want to process data as it's being downloaded.\n\nBelow is a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this. We'll assume that the bytestream is coming from a URL, but the principle can be applied to any bytestream source.\n\n### Step 1: Install Necessary Libraries\n\nFirst, ensure you have `pandas` installed. If not, you can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install pandas\n```\n\n### Step 2: Streaming the Bytestream\n\nWe'll use the `requests` library to stream the file. This allows us to process the file in chunks rather than loading it all into memory at once.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom io import BytesIO\n\n# URL of the file you want to parse\nurl = 'your_file_url.csv'\n\n# Streaming the file in chunks\nresponse = requests.get(url, stream=True)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Parsing the DataFrame\n\nNow, we'll parse the DataFrame in chunks. This example assumes the file is a CSV. If your file is in a different format, you might need to adjust the `read_csv` parameters or use a different pandas function.\n\n```python\n# Initialize an empty DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame()\n\n# Process the file in chunks\nchunksize = 10 ** 6  # Adjust the chunk size as needed\nfor chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=chunksize):\n    if chunk:  # filter out keep-alive new chunks\n        # Write the chunk to a BytesIO object\n        bio = BytesIO(chunk)\n        \n        # Read the chunk into a DataFrame\n        chunk_df = pd.read_csv(bio)\n        \n        # Append the chunk to the main DataFrame\n        df = pd.concat([df, chunk_df], ignore_index=True)\n\n# After the loop, df will contain the entire DataFrame\n```\n\n### Step 4: Handling Large Files\n\nFor extremely large files, you might want to process each chunk as you receive it, rather than concatenating them into a single DataFrame. This approach can help manage memory usage.\n\n```python\nfor chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=chunksize):\n    if chunk:\n        bio = BytesIO(chunk)\n        chunk_df = pd.read_csv(bio)\n        \n        # Process chunk_df here instead of concatenating\n        # For example, you could write it to a database or another file\n        process_chunk(chunk_df)\n\ndef process_chunk(df):\n    # Your processing logic here\n    pass\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis approach allows you to parse a DataFrame from a bytestream without loading the entire file into memory, making it suitable for large files or constrained environments. Adjust the `chunksize` variable based on your specific needs and the characteristics of your data.", "search_done": false}

We want to find the expected number of rounds to end the game, which we'll denote as E(N, T), where N is the number of unique numbers assigned to the player and T is the total number of numbers.\n\nLet's consider the first round. There are T numbers to choose from, and N of them are \"good\" (i.e., assigned to the player). The probability of drawing a good number in the first round is N/T.\n\nNow, let's consider two cases:\n\n1. A good number is drawn in the first round. In this case, the game is not over yet, and we have N-1 good numbers left to draw. The expected number of rounds to end the game from this point is E(N-1, T-1), since we've already drawn one number.\n2. A bad number is drawn in the first round. In this case, the game is still not over, and we still have N good numbers to draw. The expected number of rounds to end the game from this point is E(N, T-1), since we've already drawn one bad number.\n\nUsing the law of total expectation, we can write the recursive formula:\n\nE(N, T) = (N/T) \\* (1 + E(N-1, T-1)) + ((T-N)/T) \\* (1 + E(N, T-1))\n\nThe first term represents the case where a good number is drawn, and the second term represents the case where a bad number is drawn. The \"1 +\" in each term accounts for the fact that we've already completed one round.\n\nSimplifying the formula, we get:\n\nE(N, T) = 1 + (N/T) \\* E(N-1, T-1) + ((T-N)/T) \\* E(N, T-1)\n\nThis is the recursive formula for the expected number of rounds to end the game.\n\nNote that the base cases are:\n\n* E(0, T) = 0, since the game is already over if there are no good numbers left to draw.\n* E(N, N) = N, since the game will end in exactly N rounds if all good numbers are drawn in the first N rounds.\n\nI hope this helps!

It uses the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm, which is an efficient and unbiased method for generating a random permutation.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:\n\n1. Make a copy of the input sequence to avoid modifying it in place.\n2. Iterate over the sequence from the last element to the first element (in reverse order).\n3. For each element, generate a random index `j` between 0 and the current index `i`.\n4. Swap the elements at indices `i` and `j`.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the entire sequence has been permuted.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input sequence. This is because we only need to iterate over the sequence once to generate the permutation.\n\n**Space Complexity**\n\nThe space complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input sequence.

{"question_id": "arena_hard_6", "response": "A popular topic in computer graphics!\n\nA Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) is a data structure used to accelerate ray tracing by reducing the number of intersection tests between rays and scene objects. Here are the most common optimizations for BVHs in ray tracing:\n\n1. **SAH (Surface Area Heuristic)**: This is a popular method for building BVHs. The SAH chooses the split plane that minimizes the surface area of the two child nodes, which reduces the number of intersection tests.\n2. **Median Split**: A simple and fast method that splits the bounding box at the median of the object centroids. This method is often used as a fallback when SAH is too expensive.\n3. **Spatial Split**: This method splits the bounding box into two child nodes based on the spatial distribution of objects. It can be more efficient than SAH for scenes with a large number of small objects.\n4. **Multi-Level BVH**: This optimization involves building a hierarchy of BVHs, where each level represents a coarser or finer subdivision of the scene. This can reduce the number of intersection tests and improve performance.\n5. **Quantization**: This technique reduces the precision of the bounding box coordinates, which can lead to a smaller BVH and faster traversal.\n6. **BVH Refitting**: After the initial BVH construction, the bounding boxes can be refitted to better enclose the objects. This can reduce the number of intersection tests and improve performance.\n7. **Lazy Construction**: Instead of building the entire BVH upfront, lazy construction builds the BVH on-the-fly as the ray tracing algorithm traverses the scene. This can reduce memory usage and improve performance.\n8. **Thread-Level Parallelism**: Modern CPUs have multiple cores, and BVH construction can be parallelized across these cores. This can significantly speed up the construction process.\n9. **GPU Acceleration**: Some modern GPUs have dedicated hardware for ray tracing, which can accelerate BVH construction and traversal.\n10. **Pre-Computed Visibility**: This technique pre-computes the visibility of objects from certain viewpoints, which can reduce the number of intersection tests and improve performance.\n\nThese optimizations can be combined and tailored to specific use cases to achieve the best performance for a given scene and rendering algorithm.", "search_done": false}
{"question_id": "arena_hard_7", "response": "To delete a folder from a connected filesystem in a Synapse notebook, you will typically use the `synapseclient` library to interact with Synapse and Python's standard library for file system operations. However, directly deleting a folder from a connected filesystem using Synapse's API is not straightforward because Synapse primarily manages files and folders within its own ecosystem. If you're looking to delete a folder from a mounted filesystem that is connected to Synapse (like an Azure Blob Storage or an Amazon S3 bucket), you would typically use the specific client libraries for those services or generic file system operations if the storage is mounted locally.\n\nFor the sake of this example, let's assume you're working with a mounted filesystem that you can access like a local directory. We'll use Python's `shutil` module to delete the folder. Please ensure you have the necessary permissions to delete files and folders.\n\nHere's a basic example of how you might delete a folder in a Synapse notebook:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport shutil\n\n# Specify the path to the folder you want to delete\nfolder_path = '/path/to/your/folder'\n\n# Check if the folder exists\nif os.path.exists(folder_path):\n    try:\n        # Attempt to delete the folder\n        shutil.rmtree(folder_path)\n        print(f\"Successfully deleted the folder: {folder_path}\")\n    except OSError as e:\n        print(f\"Error deleting the folder: {e.filename} - {e.strerror}.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"The folder does not exist: {folder_path}\")\n```\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n1. **Permissions**: Ensure your Synapse user or service account has the necessary permissions to delete files and folders in the target filesystem.\n2. **Path**: The `folder_path` should be the absolute path to the folder you wish to delete. If the folder is located in a Synapse-mounted storage, ensure you're using the correct path as seen by the Synapse environment.\n3. **Use with Caution**: Deleting folders and their contents is irreversible. Always double-check the path and ensure you're deleting the correct folder to avoid data loss.\n\nIf you're working with cloud storage services like Azure Blob Storage or AWS S3, you would typically use the respective SDKs (e.g., `azure-storage-blob` for Azure, `boto3` for AWS) to manage folders and files.

{"question_id": "arena_hard_11", "response": "To generate SystemVerilog constraints that ensure the number of transitions from the previous output is exactly 5 in a 32-bit number, you can use the following approach. This involves calculating the number of transitions (bit flips) between two consecutive 32-bit numbers.\n\nFirst, let's define a function to calculate the number of transitions between two bits. Then, we'll use this function within a constraint to ensure that the total number of transitions between the current output and the previous output is exactly 5.\n\nHere's an example of how you might implement this in SystemVerilog:\n\n```systemverilog\nclass my_constraint extends base_constraint;\n  rand bit [31:0] current_output;\n  bit [31:0] previous_output;\n\n  constraint transitions {\n    // Calculate the number of transitions\n    int transitions = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) begin\n      if (current_output[i] !== previous_output[i]) transitions++;\n    end\n    // Ensure the number of transitions is exactly 5\n    transitions == 5;\n  }\n\n  // Example usage\n  function void post_randomize();\n    // Example: Display the current and previous outputs and the number of transitions\n    $display(\"Current Output: %h, Previous Output: %h, Transitions: %d\",\n             current_output, previous_output, transitions);\n  endfunction\nendclass\n```\n\nHowever, the above code snippet directly calculates the transitions but does not enforce the constraint directly in a synthesizable way. For a more synthesizable approach, you might need to rethink how you're applying the constraint, especially if you're looking to synthesize this logic.\n\nA synthesizable approach might involve using a more direct method to ensure the number of transitions, possibly by manipulating the bits directly in a way that always results in exactly 5 transitions. However, this would likely require a more complex logic that directly manipulates the bits based on the previous output, which isn't straightforward to express as a simple constraint.\n\nFor simulation purposes, the above approach works well. But if you're looking to synthesize this, you'd need to implement a digital circuit that can track the previous output and generate the next output with exactly 5 transitions, which is more complex and not directly achievable through simple constraints.", "search_done": false}

{"question_id": "arena_hard_23", "response": "Removing Duplicates from a List in Python\n=====================================\n\nThere are several ways to remove duplicates from a list in Python. Here are a few methods:\n\n### Method 1: Using a Set\n\nA set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. We can convert the list to a set to remove duplicates and then convert it back to a list.\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates_set(lst):\n    return list(set(lst))\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6]\nprint(remove_duplicates_set(my_list))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nNote that this method does not preserve the original order of elements.\n\n### Method 2: Using a List Comprehension\n\nWe can use a list comprehension to create a new list that only includes unique elements.\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates_list_comp(lst):\n    return [x for i, x in enumerate(lst) if x not in lst[:i]]\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6]\nprint(remove_duplicates_list_comp(my_list))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nThis method preserves the original order of elements.\n\n### Method 3: Using a Dictionary (Python 3.7+)\n\nIn Python 3.7 and later, dictionaries maintain their insertion order. We can use a dictionary to remove duplicates while preserving the original order.\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates_dict(lst):\n    return list(dict.fromkeys(lst))\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6]\nprint(remove_duplicates_dict(my_list))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nThis method is efficient and preserves the original order of elements.\n\n### Method 4: Using the `OrderedDict` Class (Python 3.6 and earlier)\n\nIf you're using Python 3.6 or earlier, you can use the `OrderedDict` class from the `collections` module to remove duplicates while preserving the original order.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\n\ndef remove_duplicates_ordered_dict(lst):\n    return list(OrderedDict.fromkeys(lst))\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6]\nprint(remove_duplicates_ordered_dict(my_list))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nThis method is efficient and preserves the original order of elements.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nThere are several ways to remove duplicates from a list in Python. The choice of method depends on the specific requirements of your use case, such as preserving the original order of elements or using a specific Python version.", "search_done": false}

The formula is:\n\n`pi = SUM(k=0 to infinity) (1/16^k) * (4/(8k+1) - 2/(8k+4) - 1/(8k+5) - 1/(8k+6))`\n\nIn this implementation, we use a `for` loop to iterate `iterations` times, and at each iteration, we add the corresponding term to the `pi` variable. The `Math.pow` function is used to calculate the powers of 16.\n\n**Note**\n\nThe more iterations you perform, the more accurate the approximation of Pi will be. However, the calculation time will also increase. You can adjust the `iterations` variable to trade off between accuracy and performance.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n\n* Calculating Pi to a high degree of accuracy for scientific or mathematical applications\n* Demonstrating the BBP formula in a programming context\n* Exploring the trade-offs between accuracy and performance in numerical computations", "search_done": false}
{"question_id": "arena_hard_22", "response": "The infamous monad!\n\nIn Haskell, a monad is a design pattern that represents a computation that can be composed together in a predictable way. It's a way to manage side effects, such as input/output or exceptions, in a pure functional programming language.\n\nTo understand monads, let's consider some real-life examples:\n\n**Example 1: A Coffee Shop**\n\nImagine you're at a coffee shop, and you want to order a coffee. You can think of the coffee shop as a monad, where the \"computation\" is the process of ordering and receiving your coffee.\n\n* `return` (or `pure` in Haskell) is like walking into the coffee shop and ordering a coffee. You give your order to the barista, and they start preparing it.\n* `bind` (or `>>=` in Haskell) is like the barista handing you your coffee. You take the coffee and do something with it (e.g., add sugar, cream, or drink it).\n* `>>` (or `then` in Haskell) is like the barista calling out your name when your coffee is ready. You go to the counter, pick up your coffee, and then do something with it.\n\nHere's some Haskell code to illustrate this example:\n```haskell\n-- CoffeeShop is a monad\ndata CoffeeShop a = CoffeeShop (IO a)\n\n-- return (or pure) is like ordering a coffee\nreturnCoffee :: String -> CoffeeShop String\nreturnCoffee order = CoffeeShop (putStrLn (\"Ordering \" ++ order) >> return order)\n\n-- bind (or >>=) is like receiving the coffee\nreceiveCoffee :: CoffeeShop String -> (String -> CoffeeShop b) -> CoffeeShop b\nreceiveCoffee (CoffeeShop io) f = CoffeeShop (io >>= f)\n\n-- >> (or then) is like the barista calling out your name\nthenDrink :: CoffeeShop String -> CoffeeShop ()\nthenDrink (CoffeeShop io) = CoffeeShop (io >> putStrLn \"Enjoy your coffee!\")\n\n-- Example usage:\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n  coffee <- returnCoffee \"Latte\"\n  thenDrink coffee\n```\n**Example 2: A Bank Account**\n\nImagine you have a bank account, and you want to perform a series of transactions (e.g., deposit, withdraw, check balance).\n\n* `return` (or `pure`) is like creating a new bank account with an initial balance.\n* `bind` (or `>>=`) is like performing a transaction on the account (e.g., deposit, withdraw).\n* `>>` (or `then`) is like checking the account balance after a transaction.\n\nHere's some Haskell code to illustrate this example:\n```haskell\n-- BankAccount is a monad\ndata BankAccount a = BankAccount (IO a)\n\n-- return (or pure) is like creating a new bank account\nnewAccount :: Int -> BankAccount Int\nnewAccount balance = BankAccount (putStrLn (\"Created account with balance \" ++ show balance) >> return balance)\n\n-- bind (or >>=) is like performing a transaction\nperformTransaction :: BankAccount Int -> (Int -> BankAccount b) -> BankAccount b\nperformTransaction (BankAccount io) f = BankAccount (io >>= f)\n\n-- >> (or then) is like checking the account balance\ncheckBalance :: BankAccount Int -> BankAccount ()\ncheckBalance (BankAccount io) = BankAccount (io >> putStrLn \"Checked balance!\")\n\n-- Example usage:\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n  account <- newAccount 100\n  account <- performTransaction account (\\balance -> deposit 50 balance)\n  checkBalance account\n\ndeposit :: Int -> Int -> BankAccount Int\ndeposit amount balance = BankAccount (putStrLn (\"Deposited \" ++ show amount) >> return (balance + amount))\n```\nIn both examples, the monad (CoffeeShop or BankAccount) represents a computation that can be composed together in a predictable way.

Otherwise, reject `y` and return to step 1.\n\n**Why it works:**\n\nThe acceptance/rejection method is based on the idea of enveloping the target distribution with the proposal distribution. The constant `c` ensures that the proposal distribution is always above the target distribution, so that the acceptance probability is always non-zero.\n\nWhen `u \u2264 f_X(y) / (c * f_Y(y))`, we accept `y` as a sample from the target distribution. This is because the probability of accepting `y` is proportional to the ratio of the target density to the proposal density, which is exactly what we want.\n\n**Choosing `Y` and `c`**:\n\nTo make the acceptance/rejection method efficient, you should choose a proposal distribution `Y` that is:\n\n* Easy to sample from\n* Similar in shape to the target distribution `X`\n* Has a small constant `c` that satisfies the condition `f_X(x) / f_Y(x) \u2264 c`\n\nA small `c` reduces the number of rejections, making the algorithm more efficient.", "search_done": false}

Name your project, e.g., \"NetworkTrafficDecoder\".\n\n**Step 2: Add npcap references**\n\nIn your project, add references to the npcap libraries:\n\n* Right-click your project in the Solution Explorer and select \"Add\" > \"Reference...\"\n* In the Reference Manager, navigate to the \"Browse\" tab and locate the npcap installation directory (e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\Npcap`)\n* Select the following DLLs:\n\t+ `npcap.dll`\n\t+ `packet.dll`\n\t+ `wpcap.dll`\n* Click \"Add\" to add the references to your project\n\n**Step 3: Implement the Windows service**\n\nIn your service class (e.g., `NetworkTrafficDecoder.cs`), add the necessary using statements and implement the service's `OnStart` and `OnStop` methods:\n```csharp\nusing System.ServiceProcess;\nusing Npcap;\n\nnamespace NetworkTrafficDecoder\n{\n    public class NetworkTrafficDecoder : ServiceBase\n    {\n        private NpcapDevice _device;\n\n        public NetworkTrafficDecoder()\n        {\n            ServiceName = \"NetworkTrafficDecoder\";\n        }\n\n        protected override void OnStart(string[] args)\n        {\n            // Initialize npcap device\n            _device = new NpcapDevice(\"\\\\Device\\\\NPF_{your_adapter_guid}\");\n            _device.Open();\n\n            // Set up packet capture\n            _device.SetFilter(\"tcp or udp\"); // capture TCP and UDP packets\n            _device.SetMode(NpcapMode.Promiscuous); // capture all packets\n\n            // Start packet capture\n            _device.StartCapture();\n        }\n\n        protected override void OnStop()\n        {\n            // Stop packet capture\n            _device.StopCapture();\n\n            // Close npcap device\n            _device.Close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nReplace `{your_adapter_guid}` with the actual GUID of your network adapter.\n\n**Step 4: Decode network traffic**\n\nTo decode network traffic, you'll need to process the captured packets. You can use the `NpcapDevice` class to read packets from the capture buffer. Here's an example of how to decode TCP packets:\n```csharp\nprivate void ProcessPackets()\n{\n    while (_device.IsCapturing)\n    {\n        // Read packets from capture buffer\n        Packet packet = _device.GetNextPacket();\n\n        // Check if packet is TCP\n        if (packet.Protocol == Protocol.TCP)\n        {\n            // Decode TCP packet\n            TcpPacket tcpPacket = (TcpPacket)packet;\n            Console.WriteLine($\"TCP packet: {tcpPacket.SourcePort} -> {tcpPacket.DestinationPort}\");\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Payload: {tcpPacket.Payload}\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n**Step 5: Install and run the Windows service**\n\nTo install the Windows service, use the `InstallUtil` tool:\n```\ninstallutil NetworkTrafficDecoder.exe\n```\nStart the service using the Services console or the `net start` command:\n```\nnet start NetworkTrafficDecoder\n```\nYour Windows service should now be capturing and decoding network traffic using npcap.\n\nNote that this is a basic example to get you started. You may need to add error handling, implement additional features (e.g., packet filtering, logging), and optimize the code for performance.", "search_done": false}

It then defines a `TFTP_Fuzzer` class that inherits from Sulley's `Fuzzer` class. The `TFTP_Fuzzer` class defines a list of protocols to fuzz and a `get_protocol` method that returns a random protocol from the list. The `fuzz` method takes a protocol as input and returns a mutated version of the protocol using Sulley's `s_mutate` function.\n\nTo use this fuzzer, you would create a `TFTP_Fuzzer` instance and call its `start` method. The fuzzer will then begin sending mutated TFTP requests to a target server.\n\nNote that this is just an example and you will likely need to modify it to suit your specific needs. Additionally, you will need to have Sulley installed and configured on your system in order to use this code.\n\nAlso, you can use `sulley` command line tool to run the fuzzer, example:\n```\nsulley -f tftp_fuzzer.py -t 127.0.0.1 -p 69\n```\nThis will run the fuzzer against a TFTP server running on `127.0.0.1` port `69`.", "search_done": false}

Since the problem statement doesn't specify a product column, I'll assume that the `basket_key` can be used to identify unique products or combinations of products. If there's a separate `product_id` column, you should use that instead.\n\nHere's a SQL query that accomplishes this task. This query uses a subquery to check if a customer has purchased the product in the previous 6 weeks. If they have, they are classified as \"existing\"; otherwise, they are classified as \"new\".\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    s1.customer_id,\n    s1.week,\n    s1.date,\n    s1.basket_key,\n    s1.sales,\n    s1.units,\n    CASE \n        WHEN s2.customer_id IS NOT NULL THEN 'existing'\n        ELSE 'new'\n    END AS customer_type\nFROM \n    sales s1\nLEFT JOIN \n    sales s2 ON s1.customer_id = s2.customer_id AND s1.basket_key = s2.basket_key\n             AND s2.week BETWEEN s1.week - 6 AND s1.week - 1\nORDER BY \n    s1.customer_id, s1.week, s1.basket_key;\n```\n\nThis query works as follows:\n\n- It selects all columns from the `sales` table (`s1`).\n- It performs a LEFT JOIN with the same `sales` table (`s2`), but with conditions:\n  - `s1.customer_id = s2.customer_id` ensures we're looking at the same customer.\n  - `s1.basket_key = s2.basket_key` ensures we're comparing purchases of the same product.\n  - `s2.week BETWEEN s1.week - 6 AND s1.week - 1` checks if there was a purchase in the previous 6 weeks.\n- The `CASE` statement checks if there was a match in the previous 6 weeks (`s2.customer_id IS NOT NULL`). If there was, the customer is classified as \"existing\"; otherwise, as \"new\".\n- Finally, the results are ordered by customer ID, week, and basket key for clarity.\n\nPlease note, this query assumes that the `week` column is numeric and represents a sequential week number.

This is crucial for making the paragraph text wrap around the image, as it allows the paragraph to start at the top of the image.\n- `.flex-image` has a margin to create some space between the image and the paragraph.\n- `.flex-paragraph` is set to `flex: 1;`, which means it will take up the remaining space in the container. This allows the paragraph to automatically format itself around the image.\n\nThis setup assumes you want the image to be on the left and the paragraph to wrap around it. If you want the image on the right, you can simply swap the order of the `img` and `p` elements in the HTML.\n\nFlexbox is a powerful layout tool, and this example demonstrates one of its many uses.

{"question_id": "arena_hard_41", "response": "Here's a draft introduction for your research on \"Data-Driven Insights into the Impact of Climate and Soil Conditions on Durian Floral Induction\":\n\n**Introduction**\n\nDurian (Durio zibethinus), known as the \"King of Fruits\" in Southeast Asia, is a highly prized and economically important crop in many tropical countries. However, durian production is often hampered by inconsistent and unpredictable flowering patterns, resulting in variable yields and reduced fruit quality. Floral induction, the process by which a plant transitions from a vegetative to a reproductive state, is a critical phase in the durian life cycle. Understanding the factors that influence floral induction is essential for optimizing durian production and improving the livelihoods of smallholder farmers who rely on this crop.\n\nClimate and soil conditions are known to play a significant role in regulating plant growth and development, including floral induction. Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events associated with climate change are likely to impact durian production, making it essential to investigate the relationships between climate, soil conditions, and floral induction in durian. While traditional approaches to understanding these relationships have relied on empirical observations and small-scale experiments, the increasing availability of large datasets and advanced analytical tools offers new opportunities for data-driven insights into the complex interactions between climate, soil, and plant physiology.\n\nThis study aims to leverage machine learning and statistical modeling techniques to analyze the impact of climate and soil conditions on durian floral induction, using a large dataset of environmental and phenological observations. By identifying key drivers of floral induction and quantifying their effects, this research seeks to provide actionable insights for durian farmers, policymakers, and researchers, ultimately contributing to the development of more resilient and sustainable durian production systems in the face of climate change.\n\n**Feel free to modify and expand on this draft as needed!**\n\nSome potential areas to consider expanding on:\n\n* Providing more context on the economic and social importance of durian production in Southeast Asia\n* Discussing the current state of knowledge on durian floral induction and the limitations of existing research\n* Outlining the specific research questions and objectives of the study\n* Describing the dataset and analytical approaches to be used in the study\n* Highlighting the potential implications and applications of the research findings", "search_done": false}
