Capsule networks are designed to explicitly model hierarchical relationships between features, which makes them effective at recognizing entities and their relationships within an image.  This is why they perform well on tasks like identifying objects in a scene, where the entities (e.g., a cat, a dog, a car) are distinct.\n\nHowever, in problems like weather pattern analysis, the \"entities\" are much less clearly defined.  Weather patterns are complex and emergent phenomena, arising from the interaction of numerous atmospheric variables.  It's harder to define discrete, hierarchical entities in such a system, making the strengths of capsule networks less applicable.  Therefore, other architectures might be more suitable for such tasks.\n", "search_done": false}

{"question_id": "arena_hard_1", "response": "You can process a large dataframe from a bytestream without loading the entire file into memory using the `iter_lines` method within a `requests` call, along with the `chunksize` parameter.  Since `requests` isn't available in the current context, I'll provide a conceptual example demonstrating how you would typically achieve this if you had access to it.  I'll also outline how to adapt this approach using the available `web_search` tool, though it won't offer the same streaming capabilities.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport pandas as pd\nimport io\n\ndef process_dataframe_from_stream(url, chunksize=1024*1024):  # Example chunk size of 1MB\n    response = requests.get(url, stream=True)  # Critical for streaming\n    response.raise_for_status()  # Check for HTTP errors\n\n    chunks = []\n    for chunk in response.iter_lines(decode_unicode=True, chunk_size=chunksize):\n        if chunk:  # Filter out keep-alive new chunks\n            chunks.append(chunk)\n            df_chunk = pd.read_csv(io.StringIO('\\n'.join(chunks)), sep=',') # Or appropriate separator\n            # Process df_chunk (e.g., append to a larger dataframe, perform calculations)\n            chunks = [] # Clear the chunk list after processing\n\n    if chunks: # Process any remaining data\n        df_chunk = pd.read_csv(io.StringIO('\\n'.join(chunks)), sep=',')\n        # Process the last chunk\n\n# Example usage (replace with your URL)\nprocess_dataframe_from_stream(\"your_dataframe_url.csv\") \n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Streaming the Response:** The `requests.get(url, stream=True)` call is crucial. It fetches the data in chunks rather than downloading the entire file at once.\n\n2. **Iterating Through Chunks:** `response.iter_lines` allows you to process the response line by line (or in specified chunk sizes).  This is where you handle each incoming piece of the dataframe.\n\n3. **Processing Each Chunk:** Inside the loop, you would typically accumulate lines into a string buffer and then use `pd.read_csv` with `io.StringIO` to parse the accumulated lines into a Pandas DataFrame chunk.\n\n4. **Processing the DataFrame Chunk:**  You can then perform operations on `df_chunk` without holding the entire dataframe in memory.  This could involve appending it to a larger dataframe, performing calculations, or writing it to disk.\n\n**Adapting to the Available `web_search` API:**\n\nSince the provided `web_search` API doesn't support streaming, you'll need to retrieve the entire content first.  This is less ideal for very large files but can still be used if the data isn't excessively large.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport io\n\ndef process_data_from_websearch(keywords):\n    search_results = web_search(keywords, topk=1)\n    if search_results:\n        content = search_results['content'] # Assuming 'content' holds the CSV data\n        df = pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(content))\n        # Process the dataframe 'df'\n    else:\n        print(\"No results found.\")\n\n# Example usage (replace with your keywords)\nprocess_data_from_websearch(\"my dataframe keywords\")\n```\n\n**Key Differences and Limitations:**\n\n* **No Streaming:** `web_search` downloads the entire content before processing.\n* **Assumed CSV Structure:** The adaptation assumes the retrieved content is in CSV format.  You'll need to adjust the parsing (e.g., using `pd.read_json`, `pd.read_html`, etc.) based on the actual data format.\n* **Size Limitations:**  This approach is limited by the amount of data `web_search` can return.  For truly massive dataframes, a streaming approach with `requests` (or similar libraries) is necessary.\n\n\nThis revised response provides a more practical approach given the available tools and highlights the limitations when streaming isn't possible.  Remember to adjust the code based on the specific format and structure of your data.\n", "search_done": false}

The game ends instantly if the player has no assigned numbers.\n\n2. **Recursive Step:**  Consider the first draw. There are two possibilities:\n\n   * **Success:** The drawn number is one of the player's assigned numbers.  This happens with probability N/T.  The game then proceeds with N-1 assigned numbers and T-1 total numbers remaining. The expected number of *additional* rounds is E(N-1, T-1). Including the current round, the total expected rounds is 1 + E(N-1, T-1).\n\n   * **Failure:** The drawn number is *not* one of the player's assigned numbers. This happens with probability (T-N)/T. The game then proceeds with N assigned numbers and T-1 total numbers remaining. The expected number of *additional* rounds is E(N, T-1). Including the current round, the total expected rounds is 1 + E(N, T-1).\n\nCombining these, we get:\n\nE(N, T) = (N/T) * (1 + E(N-1, T-1)) + ((T-N)/T) * (1 + E(N, T-1))\n\nSimplifying this leads to the more concise formula:\n\nE(N, T) = (T / N) + E(N-1, T-1)\n", "search_done": false}
{"question_id": "arena_hard_6", "response": "The most common optimizations for Bounding Volume Hierarchies (BVHs) in ray tracing include:\n\n1. **Surface Area Heuristic (SAH):** This is the most popular algorithm for BVH construction.  It aims to minimize the expected cost of ray-intersection tests by considering the surface area of bounding volumes and the probability of rays intersecting them.  Smaller surface areas and lower probabilities lead to fewer intersection tests.\n\n2. **Binning:** During BVH construction, binning helps to spatially organize primitives.  Primitives are grouped into bins based on their spatial location along a chosen axis. This can improve the efficiency of the SAH algorithm by providing a better initial guess for splitting primitives.\n\n3. **Spatial Splits:**  Instead of splitting primitives based on their object ordering (as in median splits), spatial splits divide the primitives based on their actual positions in 3D space. This often leads to tighter bounding volumes and better performance.\n\n4. **Octrees/Kd-Trees for Initial Hierarchy:**  While BVHs are typically binary trees, using an octree or k-d tree as an initial spatial partitioning structure can sometimes improve performance, especially for highly complex scenes.  These structures can provide a good starting point for the BVH construction algorithm.\n\n5. **SIMD and Multi-threading:**  Ray traversal of a BVH can be significantly accelerated by using SIMD instructions to perform multiple ray-box intersections simultaneously.  Multi-threading can also be used to parallelize the traversal process, further improving performance.\n\n6. **Ray Packet Traversal:**  Processing multiple rays simultaneously as a \"packet\" can improve memory access patterns and cache efficiency, leading to performance gains.\n\n7. **Early Ray Termination:**  When a ray intersects an object, further traversal down the BVH can be stopped if the intersection point is closer than any other potential intersection. This optimization avoids unnecessary intersection tests.\n\n\nIt's important to note that the effectiveness of these optimizations can vary depending on the specific scene and the hardware being used.  Often, a combination of these techniques is employed to achieve optimal performance.\n", "search_done": false}

{"question_id": "arena_hard_10", "response": "Terraform primarily manages infrastructure, and while it can execute scripts through provisioners, directly controlling network interfaces and binding processes to specific IPs within the EC2 instance is better handled within the instance itself using scripts or systemd units.  Terraform can help set up the necessary resources, like multiple network interfaces, but the actual binding needs to happen within the instance's operating system.\n\nHere's a combined approach using Terraform and a Python script to achieve this:\n\n**1. Terraform Configuration (main.tf):**\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_instance\" \"example\" {\n  ami           = \"ami-0c94855ba95c574c8\" # Replace with your desired AMI\n  instance_type = \"t2.micro\"             # Replace with an instance type that supports multiple ENIs\n  # ... other instance configurations\n\n  network_interface {\n    device_index = 0 # Primary network interface\n    # ... other primary interface settings if needed\n  }\n\n  # Create additional ENIs (replace count with the desired number of interfaces)\n  dynamic \"network_interface\" {\n    for_each = range(9) # Create 9 additional ENIs (total 10 including primary)\n    content {\n      device_index = network_interface.value + 1 # Assign device index starting from 1\n      # You can optionally assign a private IP or let AWS assign one\n      # private_ips = [\"192.168.1.${network_interface.value + 2}\"] # Example\n      delete_on_termination = true # Remove ENIs when instance terminates\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n# Output the private IPs of all ENIs\noutput \"private_ips\" {\n  value = [\n    aws_instance.example.network_interface[0].private_ip, # Primary ENI's IP\n    for eni in aws_instance.example.network_interface[1:]: eni.private_ip # Other ENIs' IPs\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**2. Python Script (run_scraper.py) within EC2 instance:**\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\nimport os\n\n# Retrieve private IPs from environment variables set by Terraform\nprivate_ips = os.environ.get(\"PRIVATE_IPS\").split(\",\")\n\ndef run_scraper(ip_address):\n    # Construct your Playwright script execution command\n    # Replace with your actual script and necessary arguments\n    command = [\n        \"python\", \"your_playwright_script.py\", \"--some-arg\", \"some_value\",\n        \"--ip-address\", ip_address # Pass the IP address to your script\n    ]\n    subprocess.Popen(command) # Run in the background\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    for ip in private_ips:\n        run_scraper(ip)\n```\n\n**3. Setting up the environment variable within the instance via Terraform:**\n\nAdd a `null_resource` provisioner to your `aws_instance` resource in the Terraform configuration to set the environment variable `PRIVATE_IPS`:\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_instance\" \"example\" {\n  # ... (other configurations)\n\n  provisioner \"null_resource\" {\n    connection {\n      type = \"ssh\"\n      # ... (SSH connection details)\n    }\n\n    # Set the PRIVATE_IPS environment variable\n    environment = {\n      PRIVATE_IPS = join(\",\", aws_instance.example.private_ip)\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n**4. Within your Playwright script:**\n\nUse the `ip_address` argument (passed via the `run_scraper` function) to bind your Playwright instance to the specified IP. How you do this depends on the specific libraries or methods you're using within your Playwright script to manage network connections.  You'll likely need to consult the documentation for those libraries to find the appropriate way to bind to a specific interface or IP.\n\n\n\nThis approach uses Terraform to create the necessary ENIs and a Python script within the instance to manage the scraping processes and bind them to the assigned IPs. Remember to replace placeholders like AMI ID, instance type, and your actual Playwright script command.  Also, ensure your security groups allow traffic on the necessary ports.\n", "search_done": false}

{"question_id": "arena_hard_17", "response": "The error message `Android NDK: Your APP_BUILD_SCRIPT points to an unknown file` indicates that the NDK build system cannot find your `Android.mk` file at the specified path.  This is often due to incorrect path specification, typos, or the file simply not existing.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how to troubleshoot and fix this issue:\n\n1. **Verify the `Android.mk` Path:** Double-check the path in your error message: `E:\\Dhruvin kheni\\Backup\\Backup\\Pancard_pe_loan\\Pancard_pe_loan\\app\\src\\main\\jni\\Android.mk`. Ensure this path is absolutely correct.  Common mistakes include:\n    * **Typos:** Carefully examine the path for any spelling errors.\n    * **Incorrect Directory Structure:** Confirm that the `jni` directory and `Android.mk` file exist within the `app/src/main` directory of your project.\n    * **Case Sensitivity:** While Windows is generally case-insensitive, it's good practice to ensure the casing in your path matches your file system.\n\n2. **Check for Hidden Files/Folders:**  Sometimes, the `jni` folder or `Android.mk` file might be hidden. Make sure hidden files and folders are visible in your file explorer.\n\n3. **Project Synchronization:** In Android Studio, try syncing your project with the Gradle files. This can sometimes resolve path-related issues.  Go to *File* -> *Sync Project with Gradle Files*.\n\n4. **Clean and Rebuild:**  Clean your project and rebuild it.  In Android Studio, go to *Build* -> *Clean Project*, followed by *Build* -> *Rebuild Project*.\n\n5. **NDK Version Compatibility:** Ensure your NDK version (25.1.8937393 in this case) is compatible with your project's other dependencies and build settings.  Consider updating to the latest stable NDK version if you suspect compatibility issues.\n\n6. **Simplify Project Path:**  If your project path is very long or contains spaces, try moving your project to a shorter, simpler path without spaces.  This can sometimes resolve path-related issues with the NDK build system.  For example, move it to `C:\\Projects\\Pancard_pe_loan`.\n\n7. **Check `Application.mk`:** While the error message points to `Android.mk`, also review your `Application.mk` file for any inconsistencies or errors.  Ensure it's in the same directory as `Android.mk`.\n\n8. **Relative Paths (If Applicable):** If you're using relative paths in your build scripts, make sure they are relative to the correct directory.\n\n**Example of a correct project structure (simplified):**\n\n```\nPancard_pe_loan/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 app/\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 src/\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 main/\n\u2502           \u2514\u2500\u2500 jni/\n\u2502               \u251c\u2500\u2500 Android.mk\n\u2502               \u2514\u2500\u2500 Application.mk\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 ... other project files\n```\n\nIf you've checked all of the above and are still encountering the issue, please provide the following information for further assistance:\n\n* **Contents of `Android.mk` and `Application.mk`:** This will help identify any potential issues within the build scripts themselves.\n* **Screenshot of your project's file structure in Android Studio:** This will help visually confirm the location of your `jni` folder and build files.\n* **Build output with higher verbosity:**  Increase the build output verbosity in Android Studio to get more detailed error messages. This might provide additional clues.\n\n\nBy systematically checking these points, you should be able to pinpoint the cause of the error and get your NDK build working correctly.\n", "search_done": false}

{"question_id": "arena_hard_22", "response": "In Haskell, a monad is a concept that represents computations in a specific context.  It's a way to chain operations together while managing side effects or special computational contexts like handling potential errors, dealing with non-deterministic results, or working with state.  Think of it as a design pattern for composing functions that work within these special contexts.\n\nHere's a breakdown with real-life analogies:\n\n**1. The Box Analogy (Maybe Monad):**\n\nImagine you have a process that might return a value or nothing.  This is like having a box that *may* contain a present.\n\n* **`Just a`**:  The box contains a present (`a`).\n* **`Nothing`**: The box is empty.\n\nThe `Maybe` monad helps you work with this uncertainty.  You can define functions that operate on the *contents* of the box *if it exists* without having to constantly check if the box is empty.\n\n**Example:** Searching for a book in a library. You might find it (`Just book`), or it might not be there (`Nothing`).\n\n**2. The List Analogy (List Monad):**\n\nThink of a computation that can return multiple possible results. This is like having a bag of marbles, where each marble represents a different outcome.\n\n* **`[a]`**: A list of possible values (`a`).\n\nThe `List` monad lets you apply functions to *each* marble in the bag independently.\n\n**Example:**  Rolling a die.  The possible outcomes are `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.\n\n**3. The Container Analogy (IO Monad):**\n\nImagine you have a computation that interacts with the outside world (e.g., reading a file, printing to the console). These actions are like containers that hold the result of the interaction *and* the side effect.\n\n* **`IO a`**: Represents a computation that produces a value of type `a` and performs some side effect.\n\nThe `IO` monad helps you manage these side effects in a controlled way, ensuring that they happen in the correct order.\n\n**Example:** Baking a cake. You have a recipe (the computation), ingredients (input), and the actual cake (output). The side effect is the transformation of ingredients into a cake, involving actions like mixing, baking, etc.  The `IO` monad would represent the entire process of baking, including the actions and the resulting cake.\n\n\nWhile I can't directly demonstrate Haskell code here, I hope these real-world analogies help you understand the core concepts of monads:\n\n* **Context:** Monads provide a context for computations (maybe, list, IO, etc.).\n* **Composition:** They allow you to chain together functions that work within that context.\n* **Side Effects:** They help manage side effects or special computational situations.\n", "search_done": false}

{"question_id": "arena_hard_25", "response": "To remove column A from the SAS dataset in your provided code, you'll need to add a `drop` statement within the data step.  Since your original code doesn't mention a column named \"A\", I'll assume you've simplified the example and want to demonstrate how to drop a column.  I'll show you how to drop a hypothetical column \"A\" and then how to adapt it to your real column name.\n\n```sas\ndata vertical3;\n\tset vertical2 (drop=A);  /* Drop column A */\nformat Treatment $Drug. Effectiveness $Effective. Sex $Sex. ;\nrun;\n```\n\nJust replace `A` with the actual name of the column you want to remove.  For example, if you want to remove the column `PatientID`, the code would be:\n\n```sas\ndata vertical3;\n\tset vertical2 (drop=PatientID);  /* Drop column PatientID */\nformat Treatment $Drug. Effectiveness $Effective. Sex $Sex. ;\nrun;\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`drop=A` (or `drop=your_column_name`)**: This option, specified within the `set` statement, tells SAS to exclude the specified column(s) when creating the new dataset `vertical3`.\n* **Placement within `set` statement**:  The `drop` option is placed inside the parentheses of the `set` statement, immediately after the input dataset name (`vertical2`).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Case Sensitivity:** SAS is case-sensitive with variable names. Make sure the name in the `drop` statement exactly matches the column name in `vertical2`.\n* **Multiple Columns:**  You can drop multiple columns by separating their names with spaces within the `drop` option. For example: `drop=A B C;`\n* **Variable Lists (using colons):** As shown in the SAS Communities example, you can use a colon (`:`) after a prefix to drop all variables starting with that prefix.  For example, `drop=Prefix: ;` would drop all variables that begin with \"Prefix\".  You can also use a double hyphen (`--`) to specify a range of variables based on their position in the dataset, but this is less reliable than using variable names directly.\n\n\nBy using the `drop` option within the `set` statement, you create a new dataset (`vertical3`) that contains all the data from the original dataset (`vertical2`) *except* for the specified column(s).  The original dataset `vertical2` remains unchanged.\nReference Website: \n\n- [Solved: Removing columns from SAS dataset using regular expression or pattern - SAS Support Communities](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Programming/Removing-columns-from-SAS-dataset-using-regular-expression-or/td-p/365282)", "search_done": true}

{"question_id": "arena_hard_29", "response": "The acceptance/rejection method is a Monte Carlo method for generating random samples from a target probability distribution $f_X(x)$, when directly sampling from $f_X(x)$ is difficult.  It uses a simpler, easier-to-sample proposal distribution $f_Y(y)$ and a constant $c$ such that $f_X(x) \\le c f_Y(x)$ for all $x$.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the provided algorithm and its rationale:\n\n**The Algorithm:**\n\n1. **Generate `y` from $f_Y(y)$:**  Draw a random sample `y` from the proposal distribution.  This should be a distribution that's easy to sample from, like a uniform, normal, or exponential distribution.\n\n2. **Generate `u` from Uniform(0, 1):** Draw a random sample `u` from a standard uniform distribution.\n\n3. **Acceptance/Rejection Condition:** If $u \\le \\frac{f_X(y)}{c f_Y(y)}$, accept `y` as a sample from $f_X(x)$.  Otherwise, reject `y` and go back to step 1.\n\n**Why does this work?**\n\nThe acceptance/rejection method works by generating samples from a scaled version of the proposal distribution ($c f_Y(y)$) and then accepting a subset of these samples that fall within the target distribution $f_X(x)$. The acceptance probability is proportional to the ratio of the target density to the scaled proposal density at the generated value $y$. This ensures that the accepted samples follow the desired distribution $f_X(x)$.\n\n**Choosing $f_Y(y)$ and $c$:**\n\n* **$f_Y(y)$:** The proposal distribution should be easy to sample from.  Its shape should be similar to the target distribution to improve efficiency.\n* **$c$:**  The constant $c$ should be as small as possible while still satisfying the condition $f_X(x) \\le c f_Y(x)$.  A smaller $c$ leads to a higher acceptance rate, making the algorithm more efficient.  The optimal value of $c$ is $c = \\sup_x \\frac{f_X(x)}{f_Y(x)}$.\n\n**Example (Illustrative, not executable without specific distributions):**\n\nLet's say we want to sample from $f_X(x)$, but it's complex. We choose a proposal distribution $f_Y(y)$ and find a $c$ such that $f_X(x) \\le c f_Y(x)$.\n\n```python\n# Illustrative example (not executable without f_X, f_Y, and c)\n\ndef acceptance_rejection(f_X, f_Y, c):\n  while True:\n    y = sample_from_f_Y()  # Replace with actual sampling from f_Y\n    u = random.uniform(0, 1)\n    if u <= f_X(y) / (c * f_Y(y)):\n      return y\n\n# Example usage (replace with actual functions and value of c)\n# sample = acceptance_rejection(f_X, f_Y, c)\n```\n\nThis code provides a basic structure.  To make it executable, you'd need to define the functions `f_X`, `f_Y`, `sample_from_f_Y`, and the constant `c` based on the specific distributions you're working with.  The `random` module would also need to be imported.\n", "search_done": false}

Here's a breakdown of how to do this and some things to consider during the upgrade process:\n\n**1. Backup your project:** Before making any changes, back up your entire project. This will allow you to revert to a working state if something goes wrong.\n\n**2. Check for Compatibility:** Upgrading from Symfony 4 to 5 can involve significant changes.  It's crucial to review the Symfony upgrade guide for potential breaking changes and necessary adjustments to your code. You can find the official upgrade guides on the Symfony website. Search for \"Symfony upgrade guide\" or go directly to the Symfony documentation.  Pay close attention to changes related to the security component.\n\n**3. Update Symfony Components:** Use Composer to update the `symfony/security` package and other related Symfony components.  The most straightforward way is to use the following command:\n\n```bash\ncomposer update symfony/security\n```\n\nThis command will attempt to update `symfony/security` to the latest version compatible with your other dependencies. If you want to specifically install version 5.0, you can use:\n\n```bash\ncomposer require symfony/security:^5.0\n```\nThis command updates the `composer.json` to require `symfony/security` at version 5.0 or higher, and then updates the package.\n\n**4. Address Deprecated Code:** After updating, run your tests and check for any deprecation notices.  Symfony often provides tools to help identify and fix deprecated code.  Address these deprecations to ensure your application is compatible with Symfony 5.\n\n**5. Clear Cache:** After updating and fixing deprecations, clear your application's cache:\n\n```bash\nphp bin/console cache:clear\n```\n\n**6. Test Thoroughly:** Test your application thoroughly after the upgrade to ensure everything works as expected.

If you change this to `center`, they will be centered, and `flex-end` will align them to the bottom.\n*   **`align-self: flex-start;`**: This is specifically for the image, ensuring it's aligned to the top even if other content might affect alignment.\n*   **`margin-right: 10px;`**: This adds a small margin to the right of the image, creating some visual separation between the image and the text.\n*   **`flex-grow: 1;`**: This is crucial for text wrapping. It allows the paragraph to expand and take up the remaining space in the container, wrapping around the image.\n\nRemember to replace `\"your-image.jpg\"` with the actual path to your image file.  You can adjust the `margin-right` value to control the spacing between the image and text.\n", "search_done": false}
{"question_id": "arena_hard_39", "response": "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n\nLet 'a' be the duration of Plan A and 'b' be the duration of Plan B.\n\nWe can set up a system of equations based on the given information:\n\n* **Monday:** 9a + 7b = 12\n* **Tuesday:** 3a + 5b = 6\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Here's one way to solve it using elimination:\n\nMultiply the Tuesday equation by 3:  9a + 15b = 18\n\nSubtract the Monday equation from the modified Tuesday equation:\n\n(9a + 15b) - (9a + 7b) = 18 - 12\n\nThis simplifies to: 8b = 6\n\nSo, b = 6/8 = 0.75 hours.\n\nNow substitute b = 0.75 back into the Monday equation:\n\n9a + 7(0.75) = 12\n\n9a + 5.25 = 12\n\n9a = 6.75\n\na = 6.75 / 9 = 0.75 hours\n\nTherefore, Plan A lasts 0.75 hours (45 minutes) and Plan B also lasts 0.75 hours (45 minutes).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{0.75}$\n", "search_done": false}

{"question_id": "arena_hard_20", "response": "The best way to install LLVM 17 in a nix shell depends on whether `llvmPackages_17` is available in your nixpkgs channel.  Recent versions *do* include it.  Therefore, the simplest approach is usually:\n\n```nix\nlet\n  pkgs = import <nixpkgs> {};\nin\npkgs.mkShell {\n  buildInputs = [ pkgs.llvmPackages_17.clang ];\n}\n```\n\nThis will give you a shell with clang 17 and its dependencies.  If you need other LLVM 17 tools, replace `clang` with the specific tool or with `llvmPackages_17` to get the entire set.\n\n**If `llvmPackages_17` is *not* available:**  You'll need to use an older nixpkgs channel or override to a specific revision that includes it.  This is generally discouraged as it can lead to inconsistencies.  However, if necessary:\n\n1. **Find a suitable nixpkgs revision:** Check the nixpkgs commit history or use `nix-channel --update` with a specific channel known to have LLVM 17.\n\n2. **Override nixpkgs:**\n\n```nix\nlet\n  pkgs = import (fetchTarball {\n    url = \"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/<commit-hash>.tar.gz\";\n    # Replace <commit-hash> with the actual hash\n    sha256 = \"<sha256-hash>\"; # Replace with the correct hash\n  }) {};\nin\npkgs.mkShell {\n  buildInputs = [ pkgs.llvmPackages_17.clang ];\n}\n```\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **`pkgs.llvmPackages_latest`:** While tempting, avoid using `pkgs.llvmPackages_latest` unless you specifically need the absolute latest version.  It can introduce instability and break compatibility with other packages.\n\n* **Building from source (generally not recommended):**  Building LLVM from source within a nix shell is complex and resource-intensive.  Nixpkgs already provides pre-built packages, so building from source is usually unnecessary and less reproducible.  If you absolutely must, refer to the NixOS Wiki instructions, but be prepared for a challenging process.\n\n* **Overriding specific LLVM components:** If you need to patch or modify a specific part of LLVM 17, use the `override` and `overrideAttrs` functions as described in the blog post you provided.  Be mindful of the complexities of overriding within extensible attribute sets.\n\n* **Compatibility:** Ensure that the LLVM 17 version you install is compatible with any other tools or projects you're using.  Mixing different LLVM versions can lead to errors.\n\n\nBy using the recommended `pkgs.mkShell` approach with the correct `llvmPackages_17` attribute, you can easily and reliably install LLVM 17 in your nix shell.  Avoid building from source unless absolutely necessary, and be cautious when overriding nixpkgs or using `llvmPackages_latest`.\nReference Website: \n\n- [Using latest LLVM in nix - sh1marin's blog](https://blog.sh1mar.in/post/nix/bump-vector-llvm/)\n- [Package request: llvmPackages_17 \u00b7 Issue #257654 \u00b7 NixOS/nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/257654)\n- [LLVM - NixOS Wiki](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/LLVM)", "search_done": true}

The `requests` library fetches the content at the URL, but since you're not logged in via Python, it likely receives an HTML page indicating that authentication is required, rather than the actual PDF.  This HTML page is then saved as a PDF, which results in the error when you try to open it.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot directly help you with logging in to Power BI with your credentials within this context, as it would involve handling sensitive information and require access to APIs beyond what's available here.  However, I can suggest some potential approaches you could explore:\n\n1. **Power BI API:** The most robust solution would be to use the official Power BI REST API. This API allows you to programmatically interact with Power BI, including downloading reports. You would need to register an application with Azure Active Directory to obtain the necessary credentials.  This approach is more complex but provides secure and authorized access.\n\n2. **Selenium or similar browser automation tools:** These tools allow you to automate browser actions, including login. You could use Selenium to control a browser instance, log in to Power BI, navigate to the report URL, and then download the PDF. This approach mimics the manual process you described. However, it can be more resource-intensive and brittle due to its reliance on the browser's behavior.\n\nIf you choose to explore the Power BI REST API, you'll find documentation and examples on the Microsoft website.
