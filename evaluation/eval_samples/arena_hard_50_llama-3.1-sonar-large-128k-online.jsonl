{"question_id": "arena_hard_6", "response": "In the context of ray tracing, Bounding Volume Hierarchies (BVHs) are a crucial data structure for efficient scene traversal and intersection testing. Here are some of the most common optimizations for BVHs:\n\n## Bounding Volume Selection\n- The choice of bounding volume can significantly impact performance. Commonly used bounding volumes include Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) and spheres. AABBs are often preferred due to their simplicity and efficiency in ray-AABB intersection tests[1].\n\n## Tree Construction\n- The construction of the BVH tree is critical. Techniques such as the Surface Area Heuristic (SAH) are widely used to determine the optimal split point for each node, minimizing the surface area of the bounding volumes and thus reducing the number of ray-volume intersection tests[1].\n\n## Adaptive Depth and Layer Expansion\n- To optimize GPU performance, adaptive depth steps can be used to expand the BVH tree. This involves expanding multiple layers at once, but doing so adaptively to avoid unnecessary expansions. For example, the f12-BVH approach expands nodes based on an adaptive depth step, ensuring that the number of BVTT (Bounding Volume Tree Traversal) nodes is optimized for GPU performance[1].\n\n## Pruning and Early Termination\n- Efficient pruning techniques are essential to reduce the number of nodes that need to be traversed. If the lower bound of the minimum distance between two bounding boxes exceeds the current upper bound of the minimum distance, the pair can be disregarded without further expansion. This early termination helps in reducing unnecessary computations[1].\n\n## Morton Code Ordering\n- Ordering the primitives using Morton codes can improve the coherence of memory access patterns, which is particularly beneficial for GPU architectures. This ordering helps in reducing memory latency and improving overall performance[1].\n\n## Balancing Tree Quality and Construction Time\n- There is often a trade-off between the quality of the BVH and the time taken to construct it. Techniques like greedy algorithms can be used to construct BVHs efficiently while maintaining a good balance between tree quality and construction time[1].\n\n## Multi-Threading and Parallelization\n- Leveraging multi-threading and parallel processing capabilities of modern GPUs can significantly speed up the traversal and intersection tests. Algorithms like gDist, which are optimized for GPUs, utilize parallel processing to compute distances between 3D meshes efficiently[1].\n\nBy incorporating these optimizations, BVHs can be made highly efficient for ray tracing applications, reducing the computational overhead and improving rendering performance.\nReference Website: \n\n- https://arxiv.org/html/2411.11244v1\n- https://fun3d.larc.nasa.gov/chapter-2.html\n- https://www.tabroom.com/index/tourn/paradigms.mhtml?category_id=63124&tourn_id=24340\n- https://www.tennantco.com/en_ca/blog.html\n- https://www.marythomphomes.com/real-estate-marketing-tools/", "search_done": true}
{"question_id": "arena_hard_9", "response": "If you are a German tax resident and want to transition your share trading activities to a corporate entity to benefit from corporate tax rates, here are some key considerations:\n\n## Type of Company\nIn Germany, you can establish a limited liability company, known as a \"Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung\" (GmbH), which is a common choice for business activities. Here are the benefits and considerations:\n\n- **Corporate Tax Rate**: The standard corporate tax rate in Germany is 15%, plus a 5.5% solidarity surcharge, resulting in an effective corporate tax rate of 15.825%[2][4].\n- **Trade Tax**: In addition to corporate tax, companies in Germany are subject to trade tax (Gewerbesteuer), which varies by municipality but typically ranges between 14% and 17% of the company's profit[2][4].\n\n## Country of Incorporation\nGiven that you are a German tax resident, incorporating a company in Germany might be the most straightforward option, but it's important to consider the overall tax implications and any potential benefits of incorporating in another country.\n\n### Germany\n- **Advantages**: Familiarity with the legal and tax system, easier to manage and comply with regulations.\n- **Disadvantages**: You would still be subject to German corporate and trade taxes, and as a German tax resident, you might face additional personal income tax on dividends or other distributions from the company.\n\n### Other Countries\nIf you consider incorporating in another country, you need to be cautious about tax residency and double taxation agreements. Here are a few points to consider:\n\n- **Tax Residency**: Ensure the company is not considered a German tax resident, which could happen if it is managed from Germany.\n- **Double Taxation**: Germany has double taxation agreements with many countries, but these agreements can be complex and may not always provide the desired tax benefits.\n- **Compliance**: Compliance with foreign tax laws and regulations can be challenging and may require additional professional advice.\n\n### Example: EU Countries\nSome EU countries offer more favorable corporate tax rates, but you must ensure that the company is genuinely operated from that country and not just a shell entity.\n\nFor example:\n- **Ireland**: Offers a corporate tax rate of 12.5% for trading income.\n- **Bulgaria**: Has a flat corporate tax rate of 10%.\n\nHowever, setting up a company in another EU country solely to avoid German taxes could be seen as tax avoidance and may trigger anti-avoidance measures.\n\n## Conclusion\nGiven the complexity and potential risks of tax avoidance, it is highly recommended to consult with a tax advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation. Here are the general steps:\n\n1. **Consult a Tax Advisor**: To understand the full implications of moving your trading activities to a corporate entity, both in Germany and in other countries.\n2. **Choose the Right Structure**: Decide whether a GmbH in Germany or a company in another country is the most beneficial, considering all tax and regulatory aspects.\n3. **Ensure Compliance**: Make sure the company is compliant with all relevant tax laws and regulations to avoid any penalties or legal issues.\n\nIn summary, while incorporating a company can offer tax benefits, it is crucial to navigate the complexities carefully to ensure compliance and maximize the benefits.\nReference Website: \n\n- https://germanpedia.com/capital-gains-tax-germany/\n- https://santandertrade.com/en/portal/establish-overseas/germany/tax-system\n- https://sftaxcounsel.com/blog/a-deep-dive-into-how-the-pfic-regime-taxes-foreign-investments/\n- https://taxnatives.com/jurisdiction/germany/\n- https://www.orrick.com/en/Insights/2024/11/Employee-Participation-Profit-Participation-Right-Genussrecht-Programs", "search_done": true}

Each variable can take any value in the domain \\([0, 2^{32} - 1]\\).\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The constraint here is to ensure that the number of transitions (bit flips) between `x` and `y` is exactly 5.\n   - This can be represented by counting the number of different bits between `x` and `y`.\n\n   Here is a way to formulate this constraint:\n   - For each bit position `i` (from 0 to 31), define a binary variable `t_i` that is 1 if the bits at position `i` in `x` and `y` are different, and 0 otherwise.\n   - Use the XOR operation to determine if the bits are different: `t_i = (x_i XOR y_i)`.\n   - Sum these `t_i` variables and constrain the sum to be exactly 5.\n\n3. **Formulating the Constraint**:\n   - Let `x_i` and `y_i` be the `i`-th bits of `x` and `y`, respectively.\n   - Define `t_i = x_i XOR y_i`.\n   - The constraint is: \\(\\sum_{i=0}^{31} t_i = 5\\).\n\n### Using Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)\n\nHere\u2019s how you can formulate this using MILP:\n\n1. **Variables**:\n   - Define binary variables `x_i` and `y_i` for each bit position `i` of the 32-bit numbers `x` and `y`, respectively.\n   - Define binary variables `t_i` to indicate if there is a transition at bit position `i`.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - Ensure `t_i` is 1 if and only if `x_i` and `y_i` are different:\n     \\[\n     t_i \\geq x_i - y_i\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     t_i \\geq y_i - x_i\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     t_i \\leq x_i + y_i\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     t_i \\leq 2 - x_i - y_i\n     \\]\n   - Constrain the sum of transitions to be exactly 5:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{i=0}^{31} t_i = 5\n     \\]\n\nHere is an example of how this could be written in a MILP formulation:\n\n```plaintext\nMinimize 0 (since we are only interested in feasibility)\nSubject to:\nt_i >= x_i - y_i for all i in {0, ..., 31}\nt_i >= y_i - x_i for all i in {0, ..., 31}\nt_i <= x_i + y_i for all i in {0, ..., 31}\nt_i <= 2 - x_i - y_i for all i in {0, ..., 31}\nSum(t_i for i in {0, ..., 31}) = 5\nx_i, y_i, t_i binary for all i in {0, ..., 31}\n```\n\nThis formulation ensures that exactly 5 bits are different between the current and previous outputs, satisfying the condition of having exactly 5 transitions[1][5].\nReference Website: \n\n- https://www.almabetter.com/bytes/tutorials/artificial-intelligence/constraint-satisfaction-problem-in-ai\n- https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10932v1\n- https://scipopt.org/doc/html/group__CONSHDLRS.php\n- https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/16/11/1512\n- https://openreview.net/forum?id=W433RI0VU4", "search_done": true}
{"question_id": "arena_hard_10", "response": "To achieve the goal of running ten instances of your Python script on a single AWS EC2 instance, each binding to a different IP address, you will need to follow these steps. However, there are some limitations and considerations to keep in mind:\n\n## Using Multiple IP Addresses on a Single EC2 Instance\nAWS EC2 instances can have multiple private IP addresses assigned to them within the same subnet, but each instance can only have one public IP address. To bind each script to a different IP address, you would typically use private IP addresses if the scripts do not need to be accessible from the internet.\n\n## Steps to Configure with Terraform\n\n### 1. Create an EC2 Instance with Multiple Private IP Addresses\nYou can configure your Terraform script to create an EC2 instance and assign multiple private IP addresses to it.\n\n```hcl\nresource \"aws_instance\" \"my_instance\" {\n  ami           = var.ec2_ami\n  instance_type = var.ec2_instance_type\n  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.my_subnet.id\n\n  // Assign multiple private IP addresses\n  private_ip = \"10.0.1.10\"\n  secondary_private_ips = [\n    \"10.0.1.11\",\n    \"10.0.1.12\",\n    \"10.0.1.13\",\n    \"10.0.1.14\",\n    \"10.0.1.15\",\n    \"10.0.1.16\",\n    \"10.0.1.17\",\n    \"10.0.1.18\",\n    \"10.0.1.19\"\n  ]\n}\n\nresource \"aws_subnet\" \"my_subnet\" {\n  cidr_block = \"10.0.1.0/24\"\n  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id\n}\n\nresource \"aws_vpc\" \"my_vpc\" {\n  cidr_block = \"10.0.0.0/16\"\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Configure Network Interfaces (Optional)\nIf you need more control over the network interfaces, you can create separate network interfaces and attach them to the EC2 instance.\n\n```hcl\nresource \"aws_network_interface\" \"my_ni\" {\n  count = 10\n  subnet_id = aws_subnet.my_subnet.id\n  private_ips = [\"10.0.1.${10 + count.index}\"]\n}\n\nresource \"aws_instance\" \"my_instance\" {\n  ami           = var.ec2_ami\n  instance_type = var.ec2_instance_type\n\n  // Attach network interfaces\n  network_interface {\n    network_interface_id = aws_network_interface.my_ni[0].id\n    device_index         = 0\n  }\n\n  // For additional network interfaces, use the `network_interface_attachment` resource\n  dynamic \"network_interface\" {\n    for_each = range(1, 10)\n    content {\n      network_interface_id = aws_network_interface.my_ni[network_interface.key + 1].id\n      device_index         = network_interface.key + 1\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Run Your Python Scripts\nAfter setting up the EC2 instance with multiple IP addresses, you can use a user data script or a configuration management tool like Ansible or Chef to run your Python scripts. Here is an example using user data to run the scripts:\n\n```hcl\nresource \"aws_instance\" \"my_instance\" {\n  // ... other configurations ...\n\n  user_data = <<-EOF\n    # /bin/bash\n    for i in {11..20}; do\n      ip=\"10.0.1.$i\"\n      nohup python /path/to/your/script.py $ip &\n    done\n  EOF\n}\n```\n\nThis script assumes that your Python script can take the IP address as an argument and bind to it.\n\n## Important Considerations\n- **IP Address Binding**: Ensure your Python script can bind to different IP addresses. This might involve modifying the script to accept the IP address as an argument.\n- **Resource Limits**: Be aware of the resource limits on your EC2 instance, such as the number of network interfaces and IP addresses you can assign.\n- **Security Groups**: Ensure your security groups allow the necessary traffic to and from the assigned IP addresses.\n\nBy following these steps, you can set up an EC2 instance with multiple private IP addresses and run your Python scripts in parallel, each binding to a different IP address. However, if you need public IP addresses for each script, you would need to use multiple EC2 instances or other networking solutions like NAT gateways or load balancers[2][3].\nReference Website: \n\n- https://k21academy.com/terraform-iac/create-ec2-on-aws-using-terraform/\n- https://intellipaat.com/blog/aws-ec2-terraform/\n- https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-stacks-explained\n- https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/40361\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFR1wWARbR4", "search_done": true}
{"question_id": "arena_hard_12", "response": "To create a 3D impossible triangle, also known as the Penrose triangle or tribar, using SVG, you can follow these steps:\n\n## Understanding the Impossible Triangle\nThe impossible triangle is an optical illusion that cannot exist in reality. It appears as a triangle with three right angles, which defies the laws of geometry.\n\n## Creating the SVG\nHere is an example of how you can create a simple 2D impossible triangle using SVG. To give it a 3D appearance, you can use shading and other visual tricks.\n\n### Basic 2D Impossible Triangle SVG\n```svg\n<svg width=\"200\" height=\"200\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <style>\n    .line {\n      stroke: black;\n      stroke-width: 2;\n    }\n    .shadow {\n      stroke: gray;\n      stroke-width: 1;\n      stroke-dasharray: 2,2;\n    }\n  </style>\n  <line class=\"line\" x1=\"50\" y1=\"50\" x2=\"150\" y2=\"150\" />\n  <line class=\"line\" x1=\"150\" y1=\"150\" x2=\"50\" y2=\"150\" />\n  <line class=\"line\" x1=\"50\" y1=\"150\" x2=\"50\" y2=\"50\" />\n  <!-- Adding shadows for 3D effect -->\n  <line class=\"shadow\" x1=\"50\" y1=\"50\" x2=\"150\" y2=\"150\" transform=\"translate(2, 2)\" />\n  <line class=\"shadow\" x1=\"150\" y1=\"150\" x2=\"50\" y2=\"150\" transform=\"translate(2, 2)\" />\n  <line class=\"shadow\" x1=\"50\" y1=\"150\" x2=\"50\" y2=\"50\" transform=\"translate(2, 2)\" />\n</svg>\n```\n\n### Enhancing with 3D Appearance\nTo enhance the 3D appearance, you can add more details such as gradients, thicker lines for the edges, and more pronounced shadows.\n\n```svg\n<svg width=\"200\" height=\"200\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <style>\n    .line {\n      stroke: black;\n      stroke-width: 4;\n    }\n    .shadow {\n      stroke: gray;\n      stroke-width: 2;\n      stroke-dasharray: 2,2;\n    }\n    .fill {\n      fill: linear-gradient(to bottom, #fff, #ddd);\n    }\n  </style>\n  <rect x=\"40\" y=\"40\" width=\"120\" height=\"120\" class=\"fill\" rx=\"10\" />\n  <line class=\"line\" x1=\"50\" y1=\"50\" x2=\"150\" y2=\"150\" />\n  <line class=\"line\" x1=\"150\" y1=\"150\" x2=\"50\" y2=\"150\" />\n  <line class=\"line\" x1=\"50\" y1=\"150\" x2=\"50\" y2=\"50\" />\n  <!-- Adding shadows for 3D effect -->\n  <line class=\"shadow\" x1=\"50\" y1=\"50\" x2=\"150\" y2=\"150\" transform=\"translate(2, 2)\" />\n  <line class=\"shadow\" x1=\"150\" y1=\"150\" x2=\"50\" y2=\"150\" transform=\"translate(2, 2)\" />\n  <line class=\"shadow\" x1=\"50\" y1=\"150\" x2=\"50\" y2=\"50\" transform=\"translate(2, 2)\" />\n</svg>\n```\n\nThis example uses basic SVG elements and styling to create an impossible triangle with a 3D-like appearance. You can further customize it by adding more complex gradients, shadows, and other visual effects.\n\n## Using Tools and Resources\nIf you prefer to use tools or pre-made resources, you can explore websites like Freepik, which offer premium and free SVG vectors, including 3D geometric shapes and optical illusions[1][2]. Additionally, you can use graphic design software like Adobe Illustrator to create and customize your impossible triangle[3].\nReference Website: \n\n- https://www.freepik.com/vectors/2d-triangle/6\n- https://www.freepik.com/premium-ai-image/abstract-3d-geometric-shape-composed-vibrant-blue-yellow-purple-squares-creating-dynamic-playful-composition_337348673.htm\n- https://bringyourownlaptop.com/courses/adobe-illustrator-essentials-for-beginners\n- https://www.etsy.com/no-en/listing/689447546/impossible-triangle-svg-files-impossible\n- https://otosection.com/penrose-triangle-animation-in-figma-youtube/", "search_done": true}
{"question_id": "arena_hard_13", "response": "To create a simple chatbot using FastChat that listens on a port and responds to typed questions as well as follow-up questions, you can use the `gradio` library to handle the UI and interaction, and integrate it with your FastChat backend. Here\u2019s a step-by-step example of how you can achieve this:\n\n### Step 1: Set Up the Environment\nEnsure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install gradio ipex-llm\n```\n\n### Step 2: Install and Configure IPEX-LLM\nFollow the installation steps for IPEX-LLM as described in the [tutorial][1].\n\n### Step 3: Create the Chatbot Function\nHere is an example of how you can create a chatbot function that integrates with FastChat and uses `gradio` for the UI:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nfrom intel_extension_for_pytorch import ipex\nfrom vllm import VLLM\n\n# Load the model using IPEX-LLM optimizations\nmodel = VLLM.load_model('Llama-2-7b-chat-hf')\nmodel = ipex.optimize(model, dtype=torch.int4)\n\ndef chatbot(message, history):\n    # Preprocess the input message\n    input_text = message\n    \n    # Generate a response using the model\n    response = model.generate(input_text, max_length=100)\n    \n    # Append the response to the history\n    history.append({'role': 'assistant', 'message': response})\n    \n    return \"\\n\".join([h['message'] for h in history if h['role'] == \"assistant\"])\n\n# Create the Gradio Chat Interface\ndemo = gr.ChatInterface(\n    fn=chatbot,\n    type=\"messages\",\n    title=\"FastChat Bot\",\n    description=\"Ask me anything!\",\n    examples=[{\"text\": \"Hello\"}],\n    cache_examples=True,\n    retry_btn=None,\n    undo_btn=\"Delete Previous\",\n    clear_btn=\"Clear\",\n)\n\n# Launch the Gradio app\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Model Loading**: The `VLLM.load_model` function is used to load the LLaMA model, and `ipex.optimize` is applied to optimize the model for better performance.\n- **Chatbot Function**: The `chatbot` function takes the user's message and the conversation history as inputs. It generates a response using the loaded model and appends it to the history.\n- **Gradio Interface**: The `gr.ChatInterface` is used to create a chat interface. The `fn` parameter is set to the `chatbot` function, and various other parameters are configured to customize the UI.\n\n### Running the Chatbot\n\nTo run the chatbot, save the above code in a Python file (e.g., `chatbot.py`) and execute it using Python:\n\n```bash\npython chatbot.py\n```\n\nThis will start a web server, and you can access the chatbot interface by navigating to the URL provided in the terminal output, typically `http://localhost:7860`.\n\nThis setup allows the chatbot to listen on a port and respond to typed questions as well as follow-up questions, leveraging the capabilities of FastChat and IPEX-LLM.\nReference Website: \n\n- https://www.restack.io/p/ai-for-marketing-automation-answer-ipex-llm-tutorials-cat-ai\n- https://www.gradio.app/guides/creating-a-chatbot-fast\n- https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory\n- https://arxiv.org/html/2403.00867v3\n- https://github.com/usail-hkust/Jailjudge/", "search_done": true}

{"question_id": "arena_hard_18", "response": "Passing sensitive information like passwords via command line switches in Linux is indeed unsafe because other users can view the command line arguments using various system commands. Here\u2019s how user \"eve\" could potentially steal the password of user \"bob\" if \"bob\" passes his password as a command line parameter:\n\n## Using the `ps` command\nUser \"eve\" can use the `ps` command to list the current processes and their command line arguments. Here is an example:\n\nIf \"bob\" runs a command like this:\n```bash\n$ myprogram --password mysecretpassword\n```\n\nUser \"eve\" can then use the `ps` command to see the command line arguments:\n```bash\n$ ps aux | grep myprogram\n```\nThis will display the process details, including the command line arguments, which would reveal \"bob's\" password.\n\n## Using the `/proc` filesystem\nAnother way to access command line arguments is through the `/proc` filesystem. Each process has a directory in `/proc` that contains information about the process, including its command line arguments.\n\nFor example, if \"bob\" runs the command and it has a process ID of 1234, user \"eve\" can do the following:\n```bash\n$ cat /proc/1234/cmdline\n```\nThis will display the command line arguments of the process, again revealing \"bob's\" password.\n\n## Using `history` command (if the command is run in an interactive shell)\nIf \"bob\" runs the command in an interactive shell and the shell is configured to save command history, user \"eve\" might also be able to see the command in the shell's history file, although this would typically require access to \"bob's\" home directory and the specific shell configuration.\n\nTo avoid these security risks, it is recommended to use other methods to pass sensitive information, such as:\n- Using environment variables.\n- Reading input from standard input (`stdin`) instead of command line arguments.\n- Using secure configuration files that are properly permissions-restricted.\n- Utilizing password managers or other secure storage mechanisms.\n\nHere is an example of how \"bob\" could securely enter his password using `stdin`:\n```bash\n$ myprogram\nEnter password: mysecretpassword\n```\nOr, using a secure way to pass the password via environment variables:\n```bash\n$ export MY_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword\n$ myprogram\n```\nAnd in the `myprogram`, read the password from the environment variable instead of a command line argument.\nReference Website: \n\n- https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-change-password-in-linux/\n- https://blog.lastpass.com/posts/how-to-change-your-linux-password\n- https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Security\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwUHXL19KsI\n- https://privacy.com/blog/linux-password-manager", "search_done": true}
{"question_id": "arena_hard_16", "response": "To achieve a composable in Jetpack Compose that changes the content and position of its children based on the available space, you can leverage several key concepts and tools provided by Compose.\n\n### Using Custom Layouts and Constraints\n\nYou can create custom layouts that adapt to the available space by using the `Layout` composable and handling the constraints and measurements manually.\n\nHere is an example of how you might create a custom layout that adjusts the size and position of its children based on the available space:\n\n```kotlin\n@Composable\nfun AdaptiveLayout(\n    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,\n    content: @Composable () -> Unit\n) {\n    Layout(\n        modifier = modifier,\n        content = content\n    ) { measurables, constraints ->\n        val placeables = measurables.map { it.measure(constraints) }\n\n        // Calculate the available space\n        val width = constraints.maxWidth\n        val height = constraints.maxHeight\n\n        // Determine the layout based on the available space\n        layout(width, height) {\n            // Example: Place the first child at the top if there is enough space\n            if (height > 200.dp.toPx()) {\n                placeables[0].placeRelative(0, 0)\n                placeables[1].placeRelative(0, placeables[0].height)\n            } else {\n                // Otherwise, stack them vertically\n                placeables[0].placeRelative(0, 0)\n                placeables[1].placeRelative(0, placeables[0].height + 10.dp.toPx())\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Using Nested Scrolling and Scroll States\n\nFor more complex scenarios involving scrolling, you can use `NestedScrollConnection` to handle nested scrolling and adjust the layout based on the scroll state.\n\nHere\u2019s an example from the article on creating a collapsing toolbar, which involves adjusting the layout based on the scroll state:\n\n```kotlin\n@Composable\nfun CollapsingToolbarLayout(\n    progress: Float,\n    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,\n    content: @Composable () -> Unit\n) {\n    Layout(\n        modifier = modifier,\n        content = content\n    ) { measurables, constraints ->\n        val placeables = measurables.map { it.measure(constraints) }\n\n        layout(constraints.maxWidth, constraints.maxHeight) {\n            val expandedHorizontalGuideline = (constraints.maxHeight * 0.4f).roundToInt()\n            val collapsedHorizontalGuideline = (constraints.maxHeight * 0.5f).roundToInt()\n\n            val leoImage = placeables[0]\n            val petName = placeables[1]\n            val buttons = placeables[2]\n\n            // Use lerp to interpolate between expanded and collapsed states\n            val leoImageY = lerp(\n                collapsedHorizontalGuideline.toFloat(),\n                expandedHorizontalGuideline.toFloat(),\n                progress\n            ).roundToInt()\n\n            leoImage.placeRelative(0, leoImageY)\n            petName.placeRelative(0, leoImageY + leoImage.height)\n            buttons.placeRelative(0, leoImageY + leoImage.height + petName.height)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Combining with Lazy Lists\n\nTo combine this with a lazy list, you can integrate the custom layout with a `LazyColumn` or `LazyRow` and use the scroll state to adjust the layout.\n\nHere is a simplified example:\n\n```kotlin\n@Composable\nfun AdaptiveScreen() {\n    val scrollState = rememberLazyListState()\n    val progress = scrollState.firstVisibleItemScrollOffset / 200f // Adjust based on your layout\n\n    Column {\n        CollapsingToolbarLayout(progress = progress) {\n            // Your toolbar content here\n        }\n        LazyColumn(state = scrollState) {\n            items(100) { index ->\n                Text(\"Item $index\")\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### State Management\n\nEnsure you manage the state correctly using Compose's state management tools. This includes using `remember` to store state and `MutableState` to update it.\n\n```kotlin\n@Composable\nfun AdaptiveScreen() {\n    var isExpanded by remember { mutableStateOf(true) }\n\n    Column {\n        AdaptiveLayout {\n            if (isExpanded) {\n                // Expanded content\n            } else {\n                // Collapsed content\n            }\n        }\n        LazyColumn {\n            items(100) { index ->\n                Text(\"Item $index\")\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBy combining these techniques, you can create a composable that dynamically adjusts its content and the position of its children based on the available space and user interactions, similar to how container queries work on the web[1][2][3].\nReference Website: \n\n- https://www.droidcon.com/2024/11/26/collapsing-toolbar-in-compose-part-2/\n- https://proandroiddev.com/collapsing-toolbar-in-compose-part-2-abb4632d0b47?gi=5f1daf7b53ee\n- https://blog.stackademic.com/jetpack-compose-a-comprehensive-guide-to-ui-development-904f977e31fb?gi=d300c1185f13\n- https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/tooling\n- https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/graphics/images/customize", "search_done": true}

{"question_id": "arena_hard_22", "response": "In Haskell, a `Monad` is a type class that represents a computation that can be composed together in a predictable way, allowing for the handling of effects such as input/output, exceptions, or state changes. Here\u2019s a detailed explanation with real-life examples:\n\n## Definition and Key Functions\n\nA `Monad` in Haskell is defined by the `Monad` type class, which includes two key functions: `return` (also known as `pure`) and `>>=` (bind).\n\n```haskell\nclass Monad m where\n  return :: a -> m a\n  (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b\n```\n\n- `return` or `pure`: This function wraps a value in the monadic context.\n- `>>=` (bind): This function takes a monadic value and a function that returns another monadic value, and combines them.\n\n## Real-Life Examples\n\n### IO Monad\n\nThe `IO` monad is one of the most common examples. It represents computations that have side effects, such as reading from or writing to the console.\n\n```haskell\ngreet :: IO ()\ngreet = do\n  putStrLn \"What is your name?\"\n  name <- getLine\n  putStrLn (\"Hello, \" ++ name ++ \"!\")\n```\n\nIn this example, `putStrLn` and `getLine` are `IO` actions. The `do` notation is syntactic sugar for using `>>=` to sequence these actions. The shape of the final action (what gets printed) depends on the result of the intermediate action (`getLine`)[1].\n\n### Maybe Monad\n\nThe `Maybe` monad is used to handle computations that might fail.\n\n```haskell\ndivide :: Int -> Int -> Maybe Int\ndivide x 0 = Nothing\ndivide x y = Just (x `div` y)\n\nsafeDivision :: Int -> Int -> Maybe Int\nsafeDivision x y = do\n  result <- divide x y\n  return result\n```\n\nHere, `divide` returns a `Maybe Int` to indicate whether the division was successful. The `safeDivision` function uses `do` notation to sequence the division operation, propagating the failure if the division by zero occurs[2].\n\n### State Monad\n\nThe `State` monad is used to manage state in a computation.\n\n```haskell\ntype Counter = State Int\n\nincrement :: Counter ()\nincrement = modify (+1)\n\ngetCount :: Counter Int\ngetCount = get\n\nexample :: Counter ()\nexample = do\n  increment\n  increment\n  count <- getCount\n  lift $ print count\n```\n\nIn this example, `increment` modifies the state by incrementing it, and `getCount` retrieves the current state. The `example` function demonstrates how to sequence these stateful operations[1].\n\n### Nested Monads\n\nSometimes, monads are nested, such as when dealing with asynchronous computations that may also handle errors.\n\n```haskell\ntype TaskMaybe a = Task (Maybe a)\n\nexampleTask :: TaskMaybe Int\nexampleTask = do\n  result <- Task.delay (return (Just 42))\n  case result of\n    Nothing -> Task.fail \"Failed to get result\"\n    Just x  -> Task.succeed x\n```\n\nHere, `TaskMaybe` combines the `Task` monad (for asynchronous computations) with the `Maybe` monad (for handling failures). This example shows how to handle nested monads in a real-world scenario[2].\n\n## Power of Monads\n\nMonads provide a powerful way to compose computations that have effects. Unlike `Applicative` instances, where the shape of the computation is fixed beforehand, `Monad` instances allow the shape of the final action to depend on the results of intermediate actions. This flexibility is crucial in many real-world applications, such as parsing, state management, and error handling[1].\nReference Website: \n\n- https://blog.jle.im/entry/functors-to-monads-a-story-of-shapes.html\n- https://blog.ploeh.dk/2024/11/25/nested-monads/\n- https://blog.ploeh.dk\n- https://blog.jle.im\n- https://discourse.haskell.org/t/rust-has-no-exceptions/10729", "search_done": true}

During installation, make sure to select the option to install the Npcap driver in WinPcap compatibility mode if you need compatibility with tools that use the WinPcap API.\n\n## Set Up Your Windows Service\nCreate a Windows service using a programming language like C++, C#, or any other language that supports Windows service development. Here\u2019s a high-level overview of the steps:\n\n### 1. Create the Windows Service\nYou can use Visual Studio to create a Windows service project. Here is an example using C#:\n\n```csharp\nusing System.ServiceProcess;\nusing System.Timers;\n\npublic class NetworkTrafficDecoderService : ServiceBase\n{\n    private Timer _timer;\n\n    public NetworkTrafficDecoderService()\n    {\n        ServiceName = \"NetworkTrafficDecoderService\";\n    }\n\n    protected override void OnStart(string[] args)\n    {\n        _timer = new Timer(1000); // 1 second interval\n        _timer.Elapsed += new ElapsedEventHandler(OnTimer);\n        _timer.Start();\n    }\n\n    protected override void OnStop()\n    {\n        _timer.Stop();\n    }\n\n    private void OnTimer(object source, ElapsedEventArgs e)\n    {\n        // Call the method to capture and decode network traffic\n        CaptureAndDecodeNetworkTraffic();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Capture Network Traffic Using Npcap\nYou will need to use a library that interacts with Npcap, such as SharpPcap or Pcap.Net. Here\u2019s an example using SharpPcap:\n\n```csharp\nusing SharpPcap;\nusing PacketDotNet;\n\npublic void CaptureAndDecodeNetworkTraffic()\n{\n    // Open the device\n    var device = CaptureDeviceList.Instance[0]; // Select the first network device\n    device.Open(DeviceMode.Promiscuous, 1000);\n\n    // Start the capture\n    device.OnPacketArrival += new PacketArrivalEventHandler(OnPacketArrival);\n    device.StartCapture();\n\n    // Stop the capture after some time or based on some condition\n    // device.StopCapture();\n}\n\nprivate void OnPacketArrival(object sender, CaptureEventArgs e)\n{\n    var packet = PacketDotNet.Packet.ParsePacket(e.Packet.LinkLayerType, e.Packet.Data);\n    var tcpPacket = packet.Extract<PacketDotNet.TcpPacket>();\n\n    if (tcpPacket != null)\n    {\n        // Decode and process the TCP packet\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Source IP: \" + tcpPacket.SourceAddress);\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Destination IP: \" + tcpPacket.DestinationAddress);\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Source Port: \" + tcpPacket.SourcePort);\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Destination Port: \" + tcpPacket.DestinationPort);\n        // Process the packet data further\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Install and Start the Service\nAfter developing the service, you need to install it using the `InstallUtil.exe` tool provided by the .NET Framework, or any other method suitable for your development environment.\n\n```shell\nInstallUtil.exe YourService.exe\n```\n\nThen, start the service using the Windows Services console or via the command line:\n\n```shell\nnet start YourService\n```\n\n## Example with Pcap.Net\nIf you prefer to use Pcap.Net, here is a simplified example of how you might capture and decode network traffic:\n\n```csharp\nusing PcapDotNet.Core;\nusing PcapDotNet.Packets;\nusing PcapDotNet.Packets.Http;\nusing System;\n\npublic void CaptureAndDecodeNetworkTraffic()\n{\n    // Select the first network device\n    var device = LivePacketDevice.ListAllLivePacketDevices()[0];\n\n    using (var communicator = device.Open(65536, PacketDeviceOpenAttributes.Promiscuous, 1000))\n    {\n        communicator.SetFilter(\"tcp\"); // Filter for TCP packets\n\n        // Start the capture\n        communicator.OnPacketArrival += (sender, e) =>\n        {\n            foreach (var packet in e.Packets)\n            {\n                var tcpPacket = packet.Extract<TcpPacket>();\n                if (tcpPacket != null)\n                {\n                    // Decode and process the TCP packet\n                    Console.WriteLine(\"Source IP: \" + tcpPacket.Source.Address);\n                    Console.WriteLine(\"Destination IP: \" + tcpPacket.Destination.Address);\n                    Console.WriteLine(\"Source Port: \" + tcpPacket.SourcePort);\n                    Console.WriteLine(\"Destination Port: \" + tcpPacket.DestinationPort);\n                    // Process the packet data further\n                }\n            }\n        };\n\n        communicator.StartCapture();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates the basic steps to capture and decode network traffic using Npcap within a Windows service. You can expand on this by adding more sophisticated filtering, decoding, and analysis based on your specific requirements.\nReference Website: \n\n- https://www.comparitech.com/net-admin/tcpdump-cheat-sheet/\n- https://gbhackers.com/xplico-network-forensics-analysis-tool/\n- https://www.comparitech.com/net-admin/tcpdump-capture-wireshark/\n- https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/how-to-analyze-malicious-network-traffic/\n- https://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Cross-Platform_Content/Packet_Capture_Overview", "search_done": true}

Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nax = world.plot(color=\"white\", edgecolor=\"black\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis will display the entire world map based on the \"naturalearth.land\" dataset.\n\n## Adding Additional Layers\nIf you have another `GeoDataFrame` (e.g., `gdf`) that you want to plot on top of the world map, you can do so by specifying the axis `ax` from the previous plot:\n\n```python\nax = world.plot(color=\"white\", edgecolor=\"black\")\ngdf.plot(ax=ax, color=\"red\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis way, both datasets will be displayed on the same map.\n\n## Customizing the Plot\nYou can further customize the plot by adding titles, legends, and other elements as needed. Here is an example with some additional customization:\n\n```python\nax = world.plot(color=\"white\", edgecolor=\"black\", figsize=(10, 10))\ngdf.plot(ax=ax, color=\"red\")\nax.set_title(\"Global Map with Additional Data\")\nplt.legend([\"World\", \"Additional Data\"], loc=\"upper right\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that all data is plotted without any geographical restrictions[2][5].\nReference Website: \n\n- https://autogis-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/lesson-3/spatial-join.html\n- https://towardsdatascience.com/visualizing-geospatial-data-in-python-e070374fe621?gi=406f01c3194e\n- https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas/issues/3484\n- https://www.agsrt.com/post/unlocking-the-power-of-3d-geospatial-data-integration-with-python-programming-gisblogs-agsrt\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp6uRrzTQRY", "search_done": true}
{"question_id": "arena_hard_29", "response": "The acceptance/rejection method is a technique used to generate random samples from a target distribution when direct sampling is difficult or impractical. Here\u2019s a step-by-step explanation of the method as you described:\n\n## Step 1: Choose a Proposal Distribution\nSelect another random variable \\( Y \\) with a probability density function (pdf) \\( f_Y(y) \\) that is easy to sample from. This distribution is often referred to as the \"proposal distribution.\"\n\n## Step 2: Find a Constant \\( c \\)\nDetermine a constant \\( c > 0 \\) such that the inequality\n\\[ \\frac{f_X(x)}{f_Y(x)} \\leq c \\]\nholds for all \\( x \\) where \\( f_X(x) > 0 \\). Here, \\( f_X(x) \\) is the pdf of the target distribution \\( X \\).\n\n## Step 3: Generate \\( Y \\) and \\( U \\)\n- Generate a random sample \\( y \\) from the distribution with density function \\( f_Y(y) \\).\n- Generate a random sample \\( u \\) from a uniform distribution on the interval \\( (0, 1) \\).\n\n## Step 4: Acceptance/Rejection Criterion\nCheck if the following condition is satisfied:\n\\[ u \\leq \\frac{f_X(y)}{c \\cdot f_Y(y)} \\]\nIf this condition is true, then accept \\( y \\) as a sample from the target distribution \\( X \\). Otherwise, reject \\( y \\) and return to step 3.\n\n### Key Points\n- The proposal distribution \\( Y \\) should be chosen such that it is easy to generate samples from it.\n- The constant \\( c \\) should be made as small as possible to minimize the number of rejections and improve the efficiency of the method. A smaller \\( c \\) reduces the likelihood of rejection, making the process more efficient[4][5].\nReference Website: \n\n- https://variation.com/stat-12-verification-validation-sampling-plans-for-proportion-nonconforming/\n- https://hef.ru.nl/~tbudd/mct/mct_book.pdf\n- https://science.psu.edu/stat/smac-talks/fa24/scharf\n- https://fiveable.me/mathematical-modeling/unit-9\n- https://web.stat.tamu.edu/~quan/Sampling/STAT689_Unit3_QuanZhou.pdf", "search_done": true}
{"question_id": "arena_hard_30", "response": "To write a Python script that reads from stdin, extracts all `watch?v=` hrefs, and prints the corresponding YouTube watch URLs, you can use the following approach. This script will use regular expressions to find the `watch?v=` parameters in the input.\n\nHere is a simple script to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport re\n\n# Read input from stdin\ninput_data = sys.stdin.read()\n\n# Regular expression pattern to find watch?v= URLs\npattern = r'href=[\\'\"]?([^\\'\" >]+watch\\?v=[^\\'\" >]+)'\n\n# Find all matches of the pattern in the input data\nmatches = re.findall(pattern, input_data)\n\n# Extract and print the YouTube watch URLs\nfor match in matches:\n    # Ensure the match starts with 'http' or 'https' if not already present\n    if not match.startswith('http'):\n        match = 'https://' + match\n    print(match)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Reading from stdin**: The script reads the entire input from `sys.stdin` using `sys.stdin.read()`.\n- **Regular Expression**: The regular expression `href=[\\'\"]?([^\\'\" >]+watch\\?v=[^\\'\" >]+)` is used to find all occurrences of `href` attributes that contain `watch?v=`. The parentheses around the part of the pattern that matches the URL ensure that only the URL part is captured.\n- **Finding Matches**: The `re.findall` function is used to find all matches of the pattern in the input data.\n- **Printing URLs**: The script iterates over the matches and prints each one. If the match does not start with 'http' or 'https', it prepends 'https://' to ensure it forms a complete URL.\n\nYou can save this script to a file, for example, `extract_youtube_urls.py`, and run it using:\n\n```bash\npython extract_youtube_urls.py\n```\n\nThen, you can pipe input to the script, for example:\n\n```bash\necho '<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\">YouTube Link</a>' | python extract_youtube_urls.py\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\n```\nReference Website: \n\n- https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/requests/latest/requests.pdf\n- https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recipes-common-issues-and-their-solutions.html\n- https://docs.openstack.org/python-keystoneclient/latest/api/keystoneclient.html\n- https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/127050\n- https://gto76.github.io/python-cheatsheet/", "search_done": true}

{"question_id": "arena_hard_26", "response": "To create a TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) fuzzer using the Sulley fuzzing framework, you need to define the protocol structure and then use Sulley to generate and send malformed packets to the target TFTP server. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you get started:\n\n### Step 1: Install Sulley\nIf you haven't already installed Sulley, you can do so by cloning the repository and setting it up. However, note that Sulley is an older framework and has been largely replaced by more modern tools like Boofuzz or AFL.\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/fuzzstr/sulley.git\ncd sulley\npython setup.py install\n```\n\n### Step 2: Define the TFTP Protocol Structure\n\nTFTP uses UDP for its transport protocol and has a simple request-response structure. Here are the main packet types you'll need to fuzz:\n\n- **RRQ (Read Request)**\n  - Opcode: 1 byte (1)\n  - Filename: null-terminated string\n  - Mode: null-terminated string (e.g., \"octet\")\n  - Padding: optional\n\n- **WRQ (Write Request)**\n  - Opcode: 1 byte (2)\n  - Filename: null-terminated string\n  - Mode: null-terminated string (e.g., \"octet\")\n  - Padding: optional\n\n- **DATA**\n  - Opcode: 1 byte (3)\n  - Block Number: 2 bytes\n  - Data: variable length\n\n- **ACK**\n  - Opcode: 1 byte (4)\n  - Block Number: 2 bytes\n\n- **ERROR**\n  - Opcode: 1 byte (5)\n  - Error Code: 2 bytes\n  - Error Message: null-terminated string\n\n### Step 3: Create the Sulley Session and Define the Protocol\n\nHere is an example of how you might define a Sulley session for fuzzing TFTP requests:\n\n```python\nfrom sulley import *\n\n# Define the TFTP RRQ packet structure\ns_initialize(\"tftp_rrq\")\ns_byte(0x01) # Opcode for RRQ\ns_string(\"filename\", encoding=\"utf-8\") # Filename\ns_delim(\"\\x00\", fuzzable=False) # Null terminator\ns_string(\"octet\", encoding=\"utf-8\") # Mode\ns_delim(\"\\x00\", fuzzable=False) # Null terminator\n\n# Define the TFTP WRQ packet structure\ns_initialize(\"tftp_wrq\")\ns_byte(0x02) # Opcode for WRQ\ns_string(\"filename\", encoding=\"utf-8\") # Filename\ns_delim(\"\\x00\", fuzzable=False) # Null terminator\ns_string(\"octet\", encoding=\"utf-8\") # Mode\ns_delim(\"\\x00\", fuzzable=False) # Null terminator\n\n# Define the TFTP DATA packet structure\ns_initialize(\"tftp_data\")\ns_byte(0x03) # Opcode for DATA\ns_word(1, endian=\">\") # Block Number\ns_string(\"data\", encoding=\"utf-8\") # Data\n\n# Define the TFTP ACK packet structure\ns_initialize(\"tftp_ack\")\ns_byte(0x04) # Opcode for ACK\ns_word(1, endian=\">\") # Block Number\n\n# Define the TFTP ERROR packet structure\ns_initialize(\"tftp_error\")\ns_byte(0x05) # Opcode for ERROR\ns_word(1, endian=\">\") # Error Code\ns_string(\"error message\", encoding=\"utf-8\") # Error Message\ns_delim(\"\\x00\", fuzzable=False) # Null terminator\n\n# Create a Sulley session\nsession = sessions.session(session_filename=\"tftp_session\")\n\n# Add the TFTP requests to the session\nsession.connect(s_get(\"tftp_rrq\"))\nsession.connect(s_get(\"tftp_wrq\"))\nsession.connect(s_get(\"tftp_data\"))\nsession.connect(s_get(\"tftp_ack\"))\nsession.connect(s_get(\"tftp_error\"))\n\n# Set the target (replace with your actual target IP and port)\ntarget = sessions.target(\"192.168.1.100\", 69, udp=True)\n\n# Add the target to the session\nsession.add_target(target)\n\n# Start the fuzzing process\nsession.fuzz()\n```\n\n### Step 4: Run the Fuzzer\n\nAfter defining the protocol and setting up the Sulley session, you can run the fuzzer using the following command:\n\n```bash\npython tftp_fuzzer.py\n```\n\nThis script will start sending malformed TFTP packets to the specified target, helping you identify potential vulnerabilities in the TFTP server.\n\n### Notes\n\n- **Sulley Limitations**: Sulley is an older framework and may not be as robust or user-friendly as newer fuzzing tools.\n- **Target Specifics**: Ensure you replace the target IP and port with the actual details of the TFTP server you are testing.\n- **Safety**: Always conduct fuzzing in a controlled environment to avoid unintended consequences.\n\nBy following these steps, you can create a basic TFTP fuzzer using the Sulley framework.

Here\u2019s the difference:\n\n- **Normal Merchant Acquirer:**\n  - You need to open your own merchant account.\n  - This process can be slow and involves a lot of paperwork.\n  - You are responsible for managing your own account.\n\n- **PayFac Model:**\n  - The PayFac has one big account that many businesses use.\n  - You can start accepting payments quickly without all the paperwork.\n  - The PayFac manages the account and handles a lot of the work for you.\n\nSo, the PayFac model is faster, easier, and less complicated for small businesses like your lemonade stand, while a normal merchant acquirer requires more work and time to set up your own account[1][3][5].\nReference Website: \n\n- https://www.digitaltransactions.net/overhaul-your-payment-processing-with-payarcs-payfac-platform/\n- https://www.checkout.com/blog/cko-explains-interchange-fees\n- https://ffnews.com/newsarticle/paytech/clearent-by-xplor-launches-payfac-as-a-service-to-help-software-providers-unlock-hidden-revenue/\n- https://www.payrix.com/solutions/payfac/\n- https://akurateco.com/blog/how-to-start-a-credit-card-processing-company", "search_done": true}
{"question_id": "arena_hard_35", "response": "To determine whether a number is odd in Scheme, you can use the modulo operator to check if the remainder of the number divided by 2 is not zero. Here is a simple Scheme program that accomplishes this:\n\n```scheme\n(define (is-odd? n)\n  (not (= (remainder n 2) 0)))\n\n; Example usage:\n(display (if (is-odd? 5)\n             \"The number is odd.\"\n             \"The number is even.\"))\n(newline)\n\n(display (if (is-odd? 10)\n             \"The number is odd.\"\n             \"The number is even.\"))\n(newline)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The `is-odd?` function takes an integer `n` as input.\n- It uses the `remainder` function to calculate the remainder of `n` divided by 2.\n- If the remainder is not zero, the number is odd, so the function returns `#t` (true). Otherwise, it returns `#f` (false).\n- The `not` function is used to invert the result of the comparison, since we want to return `#t` when the remainder is not zero.\n- The example usage demonstrates how to call this function with different inputs and display the result.\n\nThis program will output:\n```\nThe number is odd.\nThe number is even.\n```\nReference Website: \n\n- https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-basic-exercise-21.php\n- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segregate-even-and-odd-numbers/\n- https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Babbage_problem\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=194467\n- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-program-to-reverse-digits-of-a-number/", "search_done": true}

{"question_id": "arena_hard_37", "response": "To use CSS Flexbox to place an image on the same line as a paragraph and have the paragraph wrap around the top and bottom of the image, you can follow these steps:\n\n## Use Flexbox to Align Items on the Same Line\nFirst, you need to create a flex container that includes both the image and the paragraph. This will ensure they are on the same line.\n\n```html\n<div class=\"flex-container\">\n  <img src=\"your-image-url.jpg\" alt=\"Your Image\" class=\"image\">\n  <p class=\"paragraph\">Your paragraph text here.</p>\n</div>\n```\n\n## Apply Flexbox Styles\nSet the `display` property of the container to `flex` to enable Flexbox layout.\n\n```css\n.flex-container {\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: flex-start; /* This ensures the paragraph starts from the top of the image */\n}\n```\n\n## Adjust Image and Paragraph Styles\nTo make the paragraph wrap around the image, you can use the `flex` property on the paragraph to allow it to take up the remaining space. However, since you want the paragraph to wrap around the top and bottom of the image, you should ensure the image does not grow or shrink excessively.\n\n```css\n.image {\n  width: 200px; /* Set a fixed width for the image */\n  height: auto; /* Maintain the aspect ratio */\n  margin: 10px; /* Optional margin for spacing */\n}\n\n.paragraph {\n  flex: 1; /* Allow the paragraph to take up the remaining space */\n  padding: 10px; /* Optional padding for spacing */\n}\n```\n\n## Example\n\nHere is a complete example:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"flex-container\">\n  <img src=\"your-image-url.jpg\" alt=\"Your Image\" class=\"image\">\n  <p class=\"paragraph\">Your paragraph text here. This text will wrap around the top and bottom of the image as it grows.</p>\n</div>\n```\n\n```css\n.flex-container {\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: flex-start;\n}\n\n.image {\n  width: 200px;\n  height: auto;\n  margin: 10px;\n}\n\n.paragraph {\n  flex: 1;\n  padding: 10px;\n}\n```\n\nThis setup ensures that the image and paragraph are on the same line, and the paragraph will automatically format itself around the top and bottom of the image as the content grows or shrinks[1][5].\nReference Website: \n\n- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-align-an-element-to-bottom-with-flexbox-in-css/\n- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Typical_use_cases_of_flexbox\n- https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/position-text-over-images-with-css/\n- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-center-image-in-css/\n- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts_of_flexbox", "search_done": true}
{"question_id": "arena_hard_36", "response": "To classify customers as \"new\" or \"existing\" based on whether they had purchased a specific product in the previous 6 weeks, you can use a combination of SQL features such as subqueries, window functions, or common table expressions (CTEs). Here is an example of how you can achieve this using a CTE and a subquery:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Previous Purchases\nFirst, create a CTE to identify whether a customer had purchased the product in the previous 6 weeks.\n\n### Step 2: Classify Customers\nThen, use this CTE to classify customers as \"new\" or \"existing\".\n\nHere is the SQL code to accomplish this:\n\n```sql\nWITH PreviousPurchases AS (\n  SELECT customer_id, basket_key, week\n  FROM sales\n  WHERE week >= (SELECT MIN(week) FROM sales) AND week < (SELECT MAX(week) FROM sales)\n  GROUP BY customer_id, basket_key, week\n  HAVING MAX(date) >= DATEADD(week, -6, (SELECT MAX(date) FROM sales))\n)\nSELECT \n  s.customer_id,\n  s.basket_key,\n  s.week,\n  s.date,\n  s.sales,\n  s.units,\n  CASE \n    WHEN pp.customer_id IS NOT NULL THEN 'existing'\n    ELSE 'new'\n  END AS customer_type\nFROM sales s\nLEFT JOIN PreviousPurchases pp\n  ON s.customer_id = pp.customer_id AND s.basket_key = pp.basket_key AND s.week = pp.week\nORDER BY s.customer_id, s.basket_key, s.week;\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **PreviousPurchases CTE**: This CTE identifies customers who have made purchases of the same product within the last 6 weeks. It groups by `customer_id`, `basket_key`, and `week`, and ensures the maximum date of purchase is within the last 6 weeks.\n- **Main Query**: The main query joins the `sales` table with the `PreviousPurchases` CTE. If a customer has a match in the `PreviousPurchases` CTE, they are classified as 'existing'; otherwise, they are classified as 'new'.\n\n### Adjustments\n- You may need to adjust the date calculations based on your specific database system's date functions (e.g., `DATEADD` is used here for SQL Server; you might use `INTERVAL` in MySQL or PostgreSQL).\n- Ensure the `week` column is correctly defined and aligned with your data structure.\n\nThis approach will help you categorize customers based on their purchase history within the specified timeframe.\nReference Website: \n\n- https://github.com/DanieltheAnalyst1/Customer_Segmentation-SQL\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nbJ0Ju0wrg\n- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/retail/retail-data-solutions/configure-frequently-bought-together\n- https://keylabs.ai/blog/applications-of-classification-models-in-retail-customer-segmentation-and-predictive-analytics/\n- https://www.interviewkickstart.com/blogs/learn/clustering-segmentation-customer-profiling", "search_done": true}

{"question_id": "arena_hard_41", "response": "When drafting an introduction for the research topic \"Data-Driven Insights into the Impact of Climate and Soil Conditions on Durian Floral Induction,\" it is crucial to set the context, highlight the importance of the study, and outline the objectives. Here is a possible introduction:\n\n---\n\nDurian (Durio zibethinus), known for its unique flavor and nutritional value, is a tropical fruit that has gained significant global attention. The cultivation of durian is highly sensitive to environmental factors, particularly climate and soil conditions, which play pivotal roles in the plant's growth, development, and reproductive processes. Floral induction, the process by which plants transition from a vegetative to a reproductive phase, is a critical stage in durian production, as it directly influences fruit yield and quality.\n\nClimate conditions, including temperature, humidity, and rainfall, have been observed to significantly impact the growth and development of durian trees. For instance, durian trees thrive in areas with well-distributed annual rainfall above 1,500 mm and warm temperatures between 25\u201335\u00b0C[3]. However, variations in these climate parameters can affect the timing and success of floral induction.\n\nSoil conditions are equally important, as they influence nutrient availability and water retention, which are essential for the optimal growth of durian trees. Different soil types can support or hinder the health and productivity of durian plants, making soil-specific management practices crucial.\n\nDespite the importance of these factors, there is a lack of comprehensive, data-driven insights into how specific climate and soil conditions impact durian floral induction. This knowledge gap hampers the development of targeted agricultural practices that could enhance durian production and sustainability.\n\nThis study aims to bridge this gap by employing advanced data analytics and experimental methods to investigate the impact of various climate and soil conditions on durian floral induction. By analyzing the interactions between environmental factors and the physiological responses of durian trees, this research seeks to provide actionable insights for farmers and agricultural policymakers. The findings of this study will contribute to the optimization of durian cultivation practices, ultimately improving the yield, quality, and sustainability of durian production.\n\n---\nReference Website: \n\n- https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/13/21/3514\n- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667064X24003452\n- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/296342000_Edible_medicinal_and_non-medicinal_plants_Volume_2_fruits\n- https://academic.oup.com/plcell/advance-article/doi/10.1093/plcell/koae279/7823124\n- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372854426_Applications_of_In_vitro_Techniques_in_Plant_Breeding", "search_done": true}

Note that this is somewhat arbitrary, as XOR on a floating-point number doesn't make mathematical sense, but we can do it for demonstration purposes.\n\nHere is the C# code to achieve this:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        // Calculate Pi and round it to 5 decimal places\n        double pi = Math.Round(Math.PI, 5);\n\n        // Convert the rounded pi to a long integer for XOR operation\n        long piLong = (long)(pi * 100000); // Multiply by 100000 to shift decimal places\n\n        // Perform XOR operation twice (the result will be the original value after two XORs)\n        long result = piLong ^ piLong ^ piLong;\n\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Pi rounded to 5 decimal places: \" + pi);\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Result after XOR operation: \" + result);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- `Math.PI` gives the value of pi.\n- `Math.Round(Math.PI, 5)` rounds this value to 5 decimal places.\n- The rounded pi value is then multiplied by 100,000 to shift the decimal places and converted to a `long` integer.\n- The XOR operation is performed twice on this integer value. Since XORing a number with itself twice will result in the original number, the final result will be the same as the initial `piLong` value.\n\nThis program will output the rounded value of pi and the result of the XOR operations, which will be the same as the original integer representation of the rounded pi.\nReference Website: \n\n- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sql/language-manual/sql-ref-functions-builtin\n- https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Pathological_floating_point_problems\n- https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Approximate_equality\n- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/number-pi\n- https://lemire.me/blog/", "search_done": true}
