There's no single, universally agreed-upon list maintained for this specific metric.  It's more complex than just counting how many times they weren't the governing party.\n\nHere's why it's difficult and requires interpretation:\n\n* **Defining \"leading\":**  Sometimes the opposition is fragmented.  While PPP might have been *part* of the opposition, another party might have had more seats, making *them* the leading opposition party.\n* **Coalition governments:**  If the PPP was part of a coalition government but not the dominant partner, were they truly the opposition or part of the government?\n* **Periods of military rule:** During periods of military rule, the concept of a \"leading opposition party\" becomes blurred or non-existent.\n\nTo get a truly accurate answer, you'd need to research the results of every Pakistani general election, analyze the seat distribution, and make a judgment call for each period based on the above factors.  This is a task best suited for a political scientist specializing in Pakistani politics.\n\nHowever, it's safe to say the PPP has been a major player in Pakistani politics and has served in opposition multiple times, though pinning down a precise number for \"leading\" opposition status is difficult.", "search_done": false}

It involves prayers, offerings, and eulogies.\n* **Kokubetsu-shiki (Farewell Ceremony):**  A final viewing and farewell to the deceased before cremation.\n* **S\u014ds\u014d (Cremation):**  Cremation is the most common practice in modern Shinto funerals.\n* **Kotsuage (Picking the Bones):**  After cremation, family members use chopsticks to transfer bone fragments from the ashes to an urn.  This is a highly ritualized and significant part of the process.\n* **N\u014dkotsu (Interment):**  The urn containing the ashes is placed in a family grave.\n* **Sh\u014dkatsu Mim\u014dshi (Post-Funeral Gathering):**  A gathering after the interment, often involving a meal, to offer condolences and support to the bereaved family.\n* **Kiyome (Purification):**  Further purification rituals for the family after the funeral.\n* **Memorial Services:**  Ongoing annual or periodic memorial services are held to honor the deceased.\n\n\nIt's important to understand that these are general practices, and the specifics can vary significantly.
