This is often done by family members or a designated person.\n\n2. **Ritual Purification**: A purification ritual may be performed to cleanse the spirit of the deceased. This can involve the use of salt or water.\n\n3. **Funeral Service**: A funeral service is held, which may include prayers, offerings, and the recitation of sutras. This can take place at home or in a shrine.\n\n4. **Cremation or Burial**: Traditionally, cremation is more common in Japan, but burial is also practiced. If cremation is chosen, the ashes are collected and placed in an urn.\n\n5. **Interment**: If the body is buried, it is placed in a grave, often with offerings of food, flowers, and other items. If cremated, the urn is placed in a family grave or columbarium.\n\n6. **Post-Funeral Rituals**: After the burial or cremation, there are often memorial services held at specific intervals (e.g., 7 days, 49 days, 1 year) to honor the deceased.\n\n7. **Ongoing Remembrance**: Families may continue to honor the deceased through regular visits to the grave and offerings at home altars (butsudan).\n\nThese steps can vary widely based on personal, familial, and regional traditions, and some families may incorporate elements from Buddhism or other practices as well.","search_done":false}
