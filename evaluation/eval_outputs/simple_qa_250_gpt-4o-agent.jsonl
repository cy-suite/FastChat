{"question_id":"simple_qa_219","response":"Thank you for providing the reference! Shinto funerals and burial customs are not as rigidly structured as in some other traditions, as Shinto focuses more on life and purity rather than death, which is often associated with impurity. However, there are several key steps typically observed in a Shinto funeral process. These steps may vary depending on the family and region, but here is a general outline:\n\n1. **Preparation of the Body**: The body is washed and dressed in a white kimono, symbolizing purity. This step is often performed by family members or funeral professionals.\n\n2. **Wake (Tsuya)**: A wake is held, during which family and friends gather to pay their respects. Offerings such as rice, sake, and flowers are placed at the altar.\n\n3. **Funeral Ceremony (Sosai)**: The funeral is conducted by a Shinto priest, who performs purification rituals and prayers. The ceremony often includes offerings to the deceased and the kami (spirits).\n\n4. **Cremation**: In modern Japan, cremation is the most common practice. The body is cremated after the funeral ceremony.\n\n5. **Bone-Picking Ceremony (Kotsuage)**: After cremation, family members use chopsticks to pick the bones of the deceased from the ashes and place them in an urn. This is a deeply symbolic and respectful act.\n\n6. **Burial or Placement of Ashes**: The urn containing the ashes is either buried in a family grave or placed in a family altar or columbarium.\n\n7. **Memorial Services**: Post-funeral memorial services are held at specific intervals (e.g., 7 days, 49 days, 1 year) to honor the deceased and pray for their spirit.\n\nThese steps reflect a blend of Shinto and Buddhist practices, as Japanese funerals often incorporate elements of both traditions.
