NAME_4 scored a superb touchdown midway through the half to give NAME_5 a 15-0 interval lead. NAME_6 scored NAME_5's third try on 57 minutes with NAME_7 giving Leinster some hope 10 minutes later. With NAME_5 having picked up some injuries, it looked like they might come under serious pressure. But the men from Galway, with skipper NAME_8 making his 275th appearance, had done more than enough to secure the long-awaited and much sought-after silverware.

In act one, NAME_1 will try and resist and spurn NAME_3's advances, such as pushing his hands away when they encroach too much on her tits, ass, and pussy. NAME_1 will find herself feeling guilty and conflicted, while her body reacts in ways that make her feel ashamed as she finds her panties getting wetter and wetter. She should start getting annoyed at NAME_3 and tell him to stop, but make no real effort to stop him.\n\nIn the second act of the story, NAME_3 begins crossing lines and NAME_1 puts up even less of a resistance. NAME_3's hand slips between NAME_1's shorts, fanning the top of her pubis mound, and over the second act eventually playing with her pussy and fingering her. At the beginning of the second act NAME_1 will still resist a bit, but NAME_1 will be betrayed by her body and too turned on to resist by the end.\n\nIn the third act, NAME_1 gets a phone call from her boyfriend NAME_2, right as NAME_3 is entering her pussy without a condom.

The numbers show the total number of air passengers for each month in those years. \\n\\n\n\nText 2: SUMMARY:\\nThe paper proposes a method to automatically compute hypergradients or gradients of hyperparameters during backpropagation, enabling hyperparameter optimization for gradient descent optimizers like SGD and NAME_1. The authors achieve this by making a simple modification to standard backpropagation. This allows hyperparameters beyond just learning rates, like momentum coefficients, to be optimized. The technique can be recursively applied to optimize hyper-hyperparameters and beyond, creating \"hyperoptimizers\". The authors find that as the number of nested hyperoptimizer layers increases, the algorithm becomes less sensitive to the initial choice of hyperparameters. They implement their approach in PyTorch and evaluate it on various neural networks for image classification, language modeling and other tasks, demonstrating the benefits of hyperoptimizers.\\n\\n\n\nText 3: SUMMARY: The paper proposes a sequence-to-sequence model named Neural Corpus Indexer (NCI) which generates relevant document identifiers directly from a query. NCI can be trained end-to-end using queries and corresponding document identifiers. To optimize NCI's performance, the paper proposes a prefix-aware weight-adaptive decoder architecture, query generation technique, semantic document identifiers, and consistency-based regularization. Experiments on NQ320K and TriviaQA datasets show that NCI achieves significant gains over baselines, with up to 21.4% and 16.8% relative improvement in Recall@1 and R-Precision respectively. NCI's enhanced MRR score demonstrates its potential as an end-to-end retrieval solution. However, NCI still suffers from scaling and efficiency issues that need to be addressed for real-world deployment.\\n\n\nList all possible text numbers related to the question.
